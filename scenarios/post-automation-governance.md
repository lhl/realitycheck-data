## Overview

This scenario matrix maps the possibility space for governance outcomes in a high-automation future. It focuses on the two most discriminating variables identified in the neofeudalism discourse analysis.

---

## Key Variables

### V1: Bottleneck Control (X-axis)

**Question**: Who controls the critical infrastructure chokepoints (compute, energy, chips)?

| Pole | Description | Indicators |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Diffuse** | Multiple competing providers; open standards; distributed energy; commodity compute | Many chip fabs globally; distributed power generation; open model parity |
| **Concentrated** | Few hyperscalers control infrastructure; vertical integration; gatekept access | 3-5 companies control majority of AI compute; power contract monopolization |

### V2: Governance Mode (Y-axis)

**Question**: Do institutions favor inclusion (buying stability) or exclusion (enforcing control)?

| Pole | Description | Indicators |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Cooperative** | Redistribution mechanisms; broad-based transfers; rights enforcement; legitimacy matters | UBI/dividend programs; strong antitrust; public goods investment |
| **Coercive** | Extraction focus; weak transfers; rights erosion; legitimacy secondary | Welfare retrenchment; surveillance expansion; democratic backsliding |

## Scenario Matrix (2x2)

|                      | **Diffuse Control** | **Concentrated Control** |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Cooperative Mode** | **A: Pluralistic Abundance** | **B: Social Dividend State** |
| **Coercive Mode**    | **C: Chaotic Multipolarity** | **D: Neofeudal/Security State** |

---

## Quadrant A: Pluralistic Abundance

**Configuration**: Diffuse bottleneck control + Cooperative governance

**Description**: Many actors control meaningful AI/automation capabilities. Open models, distributed energy, and commodity compute prevent monopolization. Governance institutions provide broad-based transfers and maintain legitimacy through inclusion.

**Characteristics**:
- Open model ecosystem thrives; frontier capabilities widely accessible
- Distributed energy and compute infrastructure
- Universal basic services or dividend programs
- Strong antitrust enforcement; interoperability mandates
- Democratic institutions remain functional
- High autonomy for individuals and small groups

**Path to this scenario**:
- Open model development continues to track frontier
- Infrastructure commoditizes rather than concentrates
- Political coalitions form around inclusion
- Multiple competing power centers prevent monopolization

**Historical analogues**: Post-WWII Western social democracies; open internet era (1995-2010)

**Who benefits**: Broad population; creators and entrepreneurs; small/medium enterprises

**Risks within this scenario**: Coordination failures; governance fragmentation; some increase in conflict potential

**Likelihood Assessment**: Medium (0.25-0.35)

---

## Quadrant B: Social Dividend State

**Configuration**: Concentrated bottleneck control + Cooperative governance

**Description**: Infrastructure is concentrated in few hands (hyperscalers, state-aligned entities), but governance institutions maintain legitimacy through robust transfer mechanisms. High inequality in *ownership* but stability through redistribution.

**Characteristics**:
- A few major entities control compute/energy infrastructure
- But: strong dividend/transfer programs funded by AI productivity
- Citizens receive share of AI-generated value
- Political legitimacy maintained through material inclusion
- Democratic forms may persist but substantive power concentrated
- "Comfortable dependency" for majority

**Path to this scenario**:
- Infrastructure concentration continues
- But: political pressure forces redistribution
- Elites calculate that buying stability < cost of coercion
- Social contracts adapt to automation reality

**Historical analogues**: Petrostates with generous transfers (Norway, UAE); Singapore model

**Who benefits**: Infrastructure owners (extremely); broad population (adequately); stability

**Risks within this scenario**: Dependency; loss of agency; vulnerability to transfer withdrawal; plutocratic capture of politics

**Likelihood Assessment**: Medium (0.20-0.30)

---

## Quadrant C: Chaotic Multipolarity

**Configuration**: Diffuse bottleneck control + Coercive governance

**Description**: Many actors have access to powerful AI/automation capabilities, but governance is fragmented and extractive. Multiple competing power centers; high conflict potential; no stable equilibrium.

**Characteristics**:
- Powerful capabilities widely distributed (including to bad actors)
- Weak or competing governance structures
- High variance in outcomes across regions/groups
- Significant conflict risk (cyber, economic, possibly kinetic)
- Some actors thrive; others suffer
- "Wild west" dynamics

**Path to this scenario**:
- Open model/distributed infrastructure succeeds
- But: governance institutions fail to adapt
- Interstate competition intensifies
- Non-state actors gain significant capabilities

**Historical analogues**: Early modern Europe (competing city-states); parts of current internet (ransomware, crypto, etc.)

**Who benefits**: Capable/resourceful actors; those in well-governed enclaves; risk-tolerant

**Risks within this scenario**: Conflict escalation; catastrophic misuse of AI capabilities; failed states

**Likelihood Assessment**: Medium (0.20-0.30)

---

## Quadrant D: Neofeudal/Security State

**Configuration**: Concentrated bottleneck control + Coercive governance

**Description**: Infrastructure monopolized by elite coalition that governs through extraction and control rather than inclusion. Managed underclass; surveillance state; democratic forms hollowed out.

**Characteristics**:
- Few entities control AI/compute/energy infrastructure
- Weak or no redistribution mechanisms
- Surveillance and control technologies deployed against populations
- Rights eroded; democratic backsliding
- Large "surplus" population managed through various means
- High inequality; low mobility; stratified society

**Path to this scenario**:
- Infrastructure concentration succeeds
- Elite coalition resists redistribution
- Coercive technologies make control viable
- Political institutions captured or hollowed out

**Historical analogues**: Classical feudalism; company towns; some authoritarian states

**Who benefits**: Elite coalition members; security apparatus; those within the "protected" sphere

**Risks within this scenario**: Instability from below; elite fracturing; international pressure; system fragility

**Likelihood Assessment**: Low-Medium (0.15-0.25)

**Note**: This is the @teortaxesTex fear scenario. The "genocide" sub-variant (CHAIN-2026-002) is assessed as very low probability (0.05-0.10) due to coordination problems.

## Probability Summary

| Scenario | Likelihood | Key Condition |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| A: Pluralistic Abundance | 0.25-0.35 | Infrastructure diffuses AND governance cooperates |
| B: Social Dividend State | 0.20-0.30 | Infrastructure concentrates BUT governance redistributes |
| C: Chaotic Multipolarity | 0.20-0.30 | Infrastructure diffuses BUT governance fragments |
| D: Neofeudal/Security State | 0.15-0.25 | Infrastructure concentrates AND governance extracts |

**Note**: Probabilities are rough assessments and sum to ~1.0. Mixed/transitional states are likely in reality.

## Key Discriminating Indicators

What evidence would tell us which scenario is emerging?

### For V1 (Bottleneck Control)

| Indicator | Diffuse Signal | Concentrated Signal |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Open vs closed model gap | Shrinking or stable | Widening |
| Chip fab distribution | More geographic diversity | US/Taiwan concentration deepens |
| Datacenter ownership | Multiple providers, distributed | Hyperscaler dominance increases |
| Energy grid structure | More distributed generation | Centralized control tightens |
| Inference costs | Falling, commoditizing | Remain high, gatekept |

### For V2 (Governance Mode)

| Indicator | Cooperative Signal | Coercive Signal |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Transfer program trends | Expansion, new programs | Retrenchment, tightening |
| Democratic quality indices | Stable or improving | Declining |
| Antitrust enforcement | Active, structural remedies | Weak, captured |
| Surveillance deployment | Constrained, oversight | Expanding, unchecked |
| Elite rhetoric | "Citizens," "inclusion" | "Threats," "security" |

## Transition Dynamics

Scenarios are not static. Key transition paths:

### A → C (Abundance → Chaos)
- Trigger: Governance failure despite diffuse capabilities
- Risk: Powerful tools in hands of bad actors without coordination

### B → D (Dividend State → Neofeudal)
- Trigger: Elites withdraw transfers once control is locked in
- Risk: "Comfortable dependency" becomes "trapped dependency"

### D → B (Neofeudal → Dividend State)
- Trigger: Instability costs exceed transfer costs
- Path: Elites calculate that buying stability is cheaper

### C → A (Chaos → Abundance)
- Trigger: New governance institutions emerge from competition
- Path: "Constitutional moments" create new social contracts

## Regional Variation

Different regions may land in different quadrants:

| Region | Current Trajectory | Likely Quadrant |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| US | Infrastructure concentrated; governance contested | B or D (depending on politics) |
| EU | Regulatory approach; infrastructure less concentrated | A or B (cooperative bias) |
| China | State-controlled infrastructure; coercive governance | D (state variant) |
| Japan | Cooperative governance; open model interest | A or B (civilized equilibrium) |
| Global South | Varied; often infrastructure-dependent | C or varies by country |

This supports GOV-2026-006: Multipolarity produces varied outcomes rather than unified trajectory.

## Using This Matrix

1. **Track indicators** to assess movement toward quadrants
2. **Identify interventions** that shift toward preferred outcomes
3. **Avoid single-narrative thinking** - multiple scenarios remain live
4. **Update probabilities** as evidence accumulates
