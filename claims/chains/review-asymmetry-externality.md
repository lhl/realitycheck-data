## Summary

**Thesis**: When artifact generation gets cheaper faster than verification, maintainer review becomes the bottleneck; open-source communities respond by increasing contribution friction.

**Overall Confidence**: 0.55 (MIN of link credences)

## Chain Structure

```
[A] LABOR-2026-007: Cheap AI artifacts → review asymmetry → maintainer burden
    ↓ implies
[B] LABOR-2026-009: Verification/integration attention becomes the scarce input
    ↓ leads to
[C] GOV-2026-019: Projects adopt stricter contribution norms (gating, prompt disclosure, contributor vetting)
```

## Weakest Link

- **Claim ID**: GOV-2026-019
- **Why**: The direction is plausible, but adoption speed and generality vary by platform features, project size, and tooling improvements.

## Notes

- This chain focuses on the economic/externality story; it does not require the “parasocial/addiction” mechanism (SOC-2026-001) to hold.
- Strong disconfirming evidence would be a broad, sustained reduction in reviewer workload per accepted change (due to CI/verification/tooling) despite increased AI-assisted contribution volume.
