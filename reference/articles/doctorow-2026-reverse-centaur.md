## Key excerpts (fair-use)
> “In automation theory, a ‘centaur’ is a person who is assisted by a machine.”

> “A reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.”

> “AI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts.”

> “We will have a lot of cheap GPUs… And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware…”

> “To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble…”
