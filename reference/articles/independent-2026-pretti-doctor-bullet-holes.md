## Notes
- Secondary reporting that quotes from and links to a primary court filing (Doc. 109) containing an unnamed physician’s declaration.
- The article uses “ICE agents” framing; other reporting on the Alex Pretti shooting attributes the shooting to CBP/Border Patrol. Treat agency attribution here as unverified unless corroborated by primary records.

## Key excerpts (fair-use)
> “Checking for a pulse and administering CPR is standard practice. Instead of doing either of those things, the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds. I asked the ICE agents if the victim had a pulse, and they said they did not know.”

> “The victim had ‘at least three bullet wounds in his back’ and they found more in his upper chest and neck when he was turned over.”
