## Key excerpts (fair-use)
> “As ChatGPT became a tool people rely on every day to get real work done, we followed a simple and enduring principle: our business model should scale with the value intelligence delivers.”

> “Compute grew 3X year over year or 9.5X from 2023 to 2025: 0.2 GW in 2023, 0.6 GW in 2024, and ~1.9 GW in 2025.”

> “While revenue followed the same curve growing 3X year over year, or 10X from 2023 to 2025: $2B ARR in 2023, $6B in 2024, and $20B+ in 2025.”

> “Compute is the scarcest resource in AI.”

> “The next phase is agents and workflow automation that run continuously, carry context over time, and take action across tools.”
