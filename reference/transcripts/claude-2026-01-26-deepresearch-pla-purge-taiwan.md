> Let's find any sources but let's also try to take into account the best OSINT, not just institutional sources. I'm less interested on the motivation of the Chinese military shakeup but more interested in what it means for China's military posture - they've removed their military elites, and those with operational experience and must now need to clear out a huge amount of leadership that must be loyal/owe their careers to the removed leaders but.. what's the net affect? China has been practicing blockades, civilian ship formations, sending drones, invading Taiwan airspace on an almost daily basis, etc. I'm interested with how this sort of things interacts w/ US flouting of international laws (Venezuela, Greenland) and what it means geopolitically (especially when you consider western world dependence on TSMC, etc). A straight out invasion seems crazy, but between the spying and funding of KMT, etc, maybe military invasion isn't all that's needed, just a warm embrace vs a rogue US?

# China's January 2026 military purge reshapes Taiwan calculus

The unprecedented purge of Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli—the PLA's only remaining combat-experienced commanders—creates significant short-term operational disruption while leaving China's fundamental pressure campaign against Taiwan accelerating. **All six uniformed Central Military Commission members appointed in October 2022 have now been removed**, leaving Xi Jinping presiding over the most depleted military command structure since the Cultural Revolution. Yet this leadership vacuum coincides with a 300% increase in PLA activity around Taiwan during 2024-2025 and the development of sophisticated gray-zone tactics that increasingly blur the line between coercion and conflict.

The strategic implications cut in contradictory directions: Xi may lack confidence to order major operations against Taiwan in the near term, yet the purges suggest he prioritizes political control over operational readiness—a calculation that could ultimately produce more risk-acceptant "wolf warrior" replacement commanders. Meanwhile, the United States' own January 2026 military intervention in Venezuela and expansionist rhetoric toward Greenland have significantly damaged Washington's standing as defender of the rules-based order, providing Beijing rhetorical ammunition should it pursue coercive measures against Taiwan. Expert consensus points to quarantine and blockade scenarios as more likely Chinese approaches than full-scale invasion, exploiting Taiwan's critical vulnerability: **only 11-14 days of LNG reserves** under normal consumption.

## The purge eliminates China's only combat-experienced commanders

On January 24, 2026, China announced investigations into Zhang Youxia (CMC Vice Chairman) and Liu Zhenli (Joint Staff Department Chief) for "serious violations of discipline and law." Both are veterans of the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War—China's last major conflict—making their removal uniquely consequential. Zhang, at 75, was Xi's childhood friend whose father was a "sworn brother" of Xi's father; Liu, at 61, was the PLA's youngest senior general, promoted specifically for his combat merit medal from 1986 border conflicts.

The cumulative scope since 2023 is staggering: Defense Ministers Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, Rocket Force Commander Li Yuchao, and the entire October 2025 wave including He Weidong (CMC Vice Chair), Miao Hua (Political Work Department), and Lin Xiangyang (Eastern Theater Commander). The CMC normally seats seven members; it now has two—Xi himself and Zhang Shengmin, the anti-corruption watchdog. Shanshan Mei of RAND captured the operational significance: "There's no one right now at the highest level who has operational experience or who is in charge of training and exercises."

Taiwan security officials assess the purge "would disrupt the chain of command, and the PLA's joint operational command capabilities would likely fall into confusion and require reorganization." The parallel to Stalin's 1930s Red Army purges—which left Soviet forces ill-prepared for the German invasion of 1941—has not escaped analysts. However, the CNA research organization offers a critical counterpoint: Xi likely views these purges as "a necessary—if painful—prerequisite" to solving corruption that undermines true military readiness. The Pentagon's 2025 China Military Power Report concludes the PLA "continues to make steady progress toward its 2027 goals" despite the turbulence, and "China expects to be able to fight and win a war on Taiwan by the end of 2027."

The short-term/long-term divergence is significant for policy. Helena Legarda of MERICS argues Xi "is less likely to take on the risks that an operation against Taiwan would entail" if he cannot trust his military to prevail. But as analyst Bill Bishop warns, "the younger, replacement generation may be real wolf warriors, so assuming this apparent chaos inside the PLA means the risks to Taiwan are lower may be risky."

## Taiwan military pressure has definitively escalated to unprecedented levels

China's military activity around Taiwan has shifted from politically-triggered responses to sustained pressure regardless of diplomatic developments. ADIZ incursions more than doubled from **1,669 in 2023 to 3,615 in 2024**, with median line crossings occurring on 209 days in 2024 versus just 62 days the year prior. January 2025 saw 200 PLAN warships operating around Taiwan compared to 112 in January 2023—an increase maintained even through the traditionally quiet Lunar New Year period.

The qualitative evolution proves equally significant. Joint Sword-2024A (May) first incorporated Taiwan's offshore islands and integrated Coast Guard vessels into exercises. Joint Sword-2024B (October) deployed the Liaoning carrier strike group east of Taiwan while six CCG fleets—double previous exercises—completed the first full circumnavigation of the island. December 2024 brought the largest single maritime deployment since 2022: 90+ ships positioned in "two parallel walls" formation simulating blockade operations targeting the entire First Island Chain.

Most alarming was Justice Mission-2025 (December 29-30), directly responding to the U.S. $11.1 billion arms package approval. The exercise featured explicit "blockade," "precision strike," and "decapitation strike" objectives. On day two, **27 rockets were fired into waters around Taiwan, with 10 landing within Taiwan's 24-nautical-mile contiguous zone**—the closest live-fire projectiles to Taiwan in over three decades. Four amphibious assault ships operated just 85 kilometers east of Taiwan while Marines conducted helicopter-borne drills.

Drone operations have normalized at an accelerating pace: **eight circumnavigations of Taiwan in 2025** compared to just three in 2024. New gray-zone tactics have emerged, particularly undersea cable sabotage—at least 11 incidents since 2023, with China unveiling a ship capable of cutting cables at 4,000 meters depth. CSIS analysis identified **128 likely gray-zone vessels** operating near Taiwan in 2024, exhibiting AIS anomalies and spending disproportionate time in military exercise zones. The pattern demonstrates systematic erosion of Taiwan's de facto maritime and airspace boundaries while building practical capability for blockade and isolation operations.

## US actions in Venezuela and beyond have damaged Washington's normative standing

The January 3, 2026 U.S. military intervention in Venezuela—capturing President Maduro and transporting him to New York for prosecution—fundamentally altered the geopolitical context for any future Taiwan crisis. UN Secretary-General Guterres declared it "a dangerous precedent" where "the rules of international law have not been respected." The operation followed Trump administration threats regarding Greenland acquisition (including refusal to rule out military force against NATO ally Denmark) and rhetoric about "taking back" the Panama Canal.

The international response reveals the damage to U.S. credibility. Brazil's Lula called for "vigorous" UN action against American "violation of international law, the United Nations Charter, and Venezuelan sovereignty." Colombia, Mexico, Chile, and South Africa issued similar condemnations. At the UN Security Council, the Venezuelan representative warned "the credibility of international law, the authority of this Organization and the validity of the principle that no State can set itself up as judge, party and executor of the world order are also at stake."

European reactions proved notably muted—what Carnegie Europe analyst Rosa Balfour attributes to "fears that Greenland will be the next stop for Trump's adventurism or of the dire consequences of US abandonment of Ukraine." German President Steinmeier alone issued stark warning against a world becoming "a den of robbers" where "the unscrupulous take what they want."

China has actively leveraged this hypocrisy. Global Times editorialized that "international law has long been treated by the US as an auxiliary tool—emphasized and invoked when it serves US global hegemony, but readily discarded when it conflicts with American interests." Carnegie's Tong Zhao offers the sharpest assessment of Taiwan implications: Washington's framing of the Venezuela operation as "law enforcement" closely mirrors Beijing's characterization of potential Taiwan action. He concludes: "The Venezuela episode may not accelerate China's unification timetable, but it will probably reinforce its expectation that international resignation, rather than coordinated resistance, may follow decisive action."

The implications extend beyond rhetoric. If the U.S. enforces maritime exclusion zones and regime change for narcotics-related claims, Beijing may calculate it gains ammunition to deflect international criticism for similar measures targeting what it considers its own territory. As the International Crisis Group observes, Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller explained the administration's view that the world "is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power"—a formulation that validates rather than constrains Chinese coercion.

## Non-kinetic coercion shows sophistication but faces structural limits

China's non-military pathways targeting Taiwan demonstrate both concerning penetration and fundamental limitations. Taiwan's National Security Bureau reported **64 individuals prosecuted for Chinese espionage in 2024**—up threefold from 16 in 2021—with 43 being active-duty military personnel. The NSB estimates over 5,000 Chinese spies currently operate in Taiwan. Recent cases include a retired lieutenant general allegedly forming an "armed organization" for wartime sabotage, four military police guarding the presidential complex, and four former DPP staffers including an assistant to Foreign Minister Joseph Wu who leaked diplomatic intelligence including travel itineraries.

Political influence operations work through existing structures rather than direct coordination. KMT legislative caucus whip Fu Kun-chi led 17 legislators to Beijing in April 2024, meeting CPPCC Chairman Wang Huning who oversees the entire United Front system. Shortly after returning, he pushed for direct shipping links to Fujian. The KMT (with TPP) subsequently blocked NT$1.25 trillion in special defense budget, froze half the indigenous submarine program funding, and cut one-third of drone infrastructure funding. Whether this reflects Chinese instruction or ideological alignment, the practical effect serves Beijing's interests.

Economic leverage through ECFA suspension has yielded limited results—Taiwan successfully diversified trade relationships while retaining semiconductor dominance as counter-leverage. TSMC produces **over 90% of the world's most advanced chips**, creating a "silicon shield" that makes global economic calculations central to any Taiwan scenario. Yet this cuts both ways: U.S. pressure for 50-50 production splitting and TSMC's $65 billion Arizona investment could eventually erode this deterrent.

The fundamental structural limit on "peaceful reunification" is Taiwanese identity itself. NCCU Election Study Center polling shows "Taiwanese only" identity rising from 17.6% in 1992 to **63.4% in 2024**, while "Chinese only" collapsed from 25.5% to under 4%. Support for maintaining some form of status quo stands at 87.4%; support for unification "as soon as possible" registers just 1.1%. Hong Kong destroyed the credibility of "one country, two systems"—all three 2024 presidential candidates rejected it. China's United Front tactics create backlash more than support, and young Taiwanese voters overwhelmingly identify exclusively as Taiwanese.

## Quarantine and blockade scenarios demand closer attention than invasion

Expert consensus increasingly points to gray-zone coercion, quarantine, and blockade as more likely Chinese approaches than full-scale amphibious invasion in the near term. CSIS surveys found **90% of U.S. experts agreed China has current capabilities for law enforcement-led quarantine** and 80% agreed on PLA-led blockade capability—but significantly lower confidence regarding invasion. Critically, only 13% of U.S. experts expressed complete confidence the United States would militarily intervene in a quarantine scenario.

The CSIS 2024-2025 blockade wargames revealed Taiwan's defenses are optimized for the wrong scenario. The "porcupine strategy"—dispersed coastal missiles, drones, and mines designed to make invasion prohibitively costly—proves inadequate for blockade situations where the adversary seeks to demonstrate control rather than conquer territory. Taiwan's energy dependence creates acute vulnerability: **97% of energy is imported**, with LNG reserves lasting only 11-14 days under normal consumption and coal reserves providing approximately 42 additional days.

A quarantine scenario exploits this vulnerability without triggering clear U.S. intervention. CSIS analysis models 10+ coast guard vessels and 20+ maritime militia vessels targeting Kaohsiung (handling 57% of Taiwan's maritime trade), with PLA surface action groups providing distant support. The operation stays below armed conflict threshold—not an act of war under international law—while Taiwan's coast guard, vastly outmatched with just 10 oceangoing vessels versus China's 150+, lacks capacity to respond. If 75% of shipping companies comply to avoid risk, China achieves strategic success without firing a shot.

The December 2025 Justice Mission exercises demonstrated precisely these capabilities: simulated blockade of Taiwan's two largest ports, explicit anti-access/area denial objectives, and exercises extending across the entire First Island Chain. The parallel to U.S. actions in Venezuela is uncomfortable: China's Maritime Safety Administration could board vessels for "safety inspections" just as the U.S. Coast Guard interdicted shipping in Venezuela's approaches.

Regarding TSMC, experts assess that capturing functioning fabs would be extremely difficult—requiring intact infrastructure, power, chemical supplies, and a willing workforce of tens of thousands of engineers. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu warned facilities would be "inoperable" in an invasion scenario. This suggests coercion through quarantine/blockade—disrupting supply chains without destroying facilities—represents a more plausible approach than seizure.

## Synthesis points toward heightened risk with uncertain timeline

The convergence of factors creates an unstable equilibrium. China's military pressure campaign has definitively escalated while its command structure undergoes unprecedented disruption. The United States has damaged its normative standing precisely as Beijing develops sophisticated gray-zone tools that exploit ambiguity in international law and alliance commitments. Taiwan faces a critical "porcupine gap"—defenses optimized for invasion while the more likely quarantine/blockade scenarios exploit energy dependence that current preparations inadequately address.

The 2027 "Davidson Window" remains significant as a capability milestone, though most experts distinguish between PLA readiness to conduct operations and actual invasion intent. Multiple "clocks" synchronize that year: the PLA centennial goal, Xi's third term conclusion, and Taiwan's next presidential election cycle. Whether Xi would risk major operations given the purge-induced command uncertainty remains genuinely unclear—though the replacement of combat-experienced leaders with potentially more ideologically driven "wolf warriors" could ultimately increase rather than decrease risk tolerance.

Three scenarios merit primary attention. First, sustained gray-zone pressure—drone incursions, cable sabotage, Coast Guard jurisdictional encroachment—aimed at psychological exhaustion and demonstrating control without triggering intervention. Second, law enforcement quarantine during a Taiwan political crisis or following a perceived provocation, testing whether the United States would militarily respond to operations staying below armed conflict thresholds. Third, combined pressure during the 2028 Taiwan election cycle, leveraging economic coercion, information operations, and military exercises to influence political outcomes.

Taiwan's most urgent priority should be energy resilience—extending LNG reserves beyond 14 days and developing alternatives to imported fuels. The asymmetric "porcupine" investments remain important but must be supplemented with capabilities relevant to quarantine scenarios where the adversary's objective is demonstration rather than conquest. For Washington, the Venezuela precedent demands serious consideration: U.S. credibility on rules-based order has weakened at precisely the moment Beijing develops tools to exploit that weakness. The normative foundations that historically supported Taiwan policy require rebuilding, or alternative frameworks emphasizing deterrence through military capability alone must be explicitly developed.

The expert assessment trajectory is sobering. Military balance has "shifted decisively," while prospects for peaceful unification "have faded." China is "no longer merely deterring independence but actively coercing Taiwan toward unification." The question is no longer whether Beijing possesses coercive tools, but whether Taipei and Washington have adequately prepared for the scenarios most likely to deploy them.
