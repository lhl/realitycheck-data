> We have a tweet essay https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2012127205728440495 that we would like to critically analyze:
> ```
> Are Americans really so retarded as to not understand what this is about?
> 
> Image
> 
> Let me spell it out, in a heavily narrativized but directionally true form. 
> There are different interests in Europe, and different interest groups. Many countries are deeply – existentially – invested in the NATO, mainly states bordering Russia. Speaking as a Russian: if there were *no* NATO, or if the US pulled out of NATO *today*, we would TOTALLY try to gobble them up. We might even retreat from Ukraine to concentrate on this. Baltics are first on the list, to secure sea access in Kaliningrad which they already threaten. Poland, Finland? They can fight well, and they're not so retarded and racist as to be incapable of diplomacy (unlike Balts) so *probably* not, but they are totally prudent to consider NATO an issue of survival. So these voices, influential thanks to the usual skin-in-the-game mechanics, American «microlateralism» doctrine, and high-ranking agents like Kallas, are dead set on preserving the alliance even at unlimited cost to other members (like Denmark, which they lowkey resent for their blissful secure affluence anyway).
> 
> Next, there's the entire nervous system of Atlanticist apparatchiks embedded in EU institutions, many educated or elevated in the US and UK, who don't care much for the continental Europe in the first place, starting with von der Leyen herself and going down; you see them and batallions of their think tankists kvetching here, minimizing and excusing American behavior, calling for accommodation and concern trolling about foolishness of resistance. Those are just enemies or at best patsies.
> 
> And there's the general «shared Western civilization» goodwill, if fraying at the seams due to Trump and trade/tech/culture wars. But the ruling political and cultural class in Europe, all these social democrats, is kin to the American Blue Tribe, and it sincerely hopes and believes that once the horrible Orange Hitler is out, the ties will be mended, apologies made, and the Enlightened Hajnali Race will focus anew on the Real Avenger Level Threats — like economic growth, free speech and capitalism, to name a few.
> 
> But there are also a few who feel differently. These are the nativist right-wingers (except ones captured by American brainworms to the point of assuming that shared Darwinian values imply shared interests, rather than more intense zero-sum competition for the same assets; an unfortunately common failure of the political mind), who don't want demographic replacement within and ALSO don't want the vassal condition for their people between nations. And there are the French, who have always chafed under the Anglo hegemony. And in the militaries and security apparatuses (relatively weak, sure, but still able to weigh in on the decisionmaking) there are, I'm sure, people with enough exposure to the American elite zeitgeist and loyal to their own nations, unironic realists.
> 
> Now, the real big shift that is happening is that the realists have started to wise up - still murkily, half-disbelieving – to what America is doing here, what it openly claims, and why.
> America is gathering resources. To fully deplete them. While the infrastructure in the imperial core is lacking and it cannot utilize everything, trade is possible, to ameliorate financial imbalances; but the longer-term objective is to end even the trade. America is growing weary of «strategically indispensable allies in the region» when said region is hard to secure or just a mere patch of dirt or sand. Baltic defense is uninteresting. Ukraine is a tedious bloody steppe, might as well let Russia have it. But a rumor of Ukraine having RARE EARTHS (even though «not rare at all») in Carpathian Mountains? Now we're talking! 300 billion barrels of oil (crappy and hard to get out, maybe non-existent) in Venezuela? Delta Force go go go! Something something HREEs in Kvanefjeld, Greenland?! Trump is clearly confused about details, completion timelines and real limiting factors, jumps the gun and stumbles, but the underlying logic of the faction he represents is consistent like an ice breaker's route. Not even TSMC is seen as valuable enough to renege on trade bullying. TSMC Taiwan is a depreciating asset; to be extracted at warp speed using stick, not carrot, the risk of accelerating the Chinese takeover be damned.  
> Now, why does this happen in this exact form? 
> To be blunt: we are IN THE ENDGAME. THIS IS LATE ANTHROPOCENE. WE WILL HAVE FULL HUMAN LABOR AUTOMATION WITHIN AT MOST A SINGLE GENERATION IF NOT A FEW YEARS. WE ARE NOW COMPETING NOT FOR MONEY OR HANDS, NOT FOR LANDS, AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR HEARTS AND MINDS, BUT FOR THE STERADIANS OF THE LIGHT CONE OF THE UNIVERSE, AND THEREFORE FOR JOULES AND ATOMS NECESSARY TO BOOTSTRAP THE LARGEST POSSIBLE SEED OF A SPACEFARING CIVILIZATION THAT WILL CONSUME ALL THE NEGENTROPY WITHIN THE COSMIC EVENT HORIZON OF EARTH. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

> This is what the Americans believe. The smart ones, like Musk, Thiel, Karp and Jason Gaverick Matheny. They think about this stuff a lot, no kidding. Even their gfs believe.
> 
> Image
> This is what the Chinese believe too, if implicitly, for their civilization has such innate understanding of performance and infrastructure that it doesn't need this kind of stuff spelled out. Still, they literally think about this as they plan their permanent underground Moon bases and orbital power generation. Did you think it's about vibes, papers, essays, «science» anon? It's not science, it's science fiction, which always has been an unsubtle political aspiration. Qian Xuesen didn't design rockets only to make the Communist Party secure. Neither did von Braun aspire to merely beat the Soviets to the Moon. That's just not how such minds work, anon.  
> 
> Image
> The Chinese have a well-oiled industrial machine at home that produces maybe 50% of All The Stuff in the world (if you're not in a bubble, you should have noted the pattern of «China makes more $stuff than The Rest Of Humanity Combined» for many values of important $stuff). Enough STEM talent to complete all remaining supply chains. A self-replicating energy infrastructure that grows exponentially. And auxiliary resource bases throughout the developing world, which could be militarized. In principle, the exponential growth factor matters more than the starting point, but in their case both are terrifyingly high and at this rate they look fit to inherit like half of the effective universe. Their economy, even as it still runs on human labor, is already entering a takeoff phase that could replicate the Great Divergence – a trend obscured by gormless «capital efficiency» or «debt» doomposting, a trend that accelerates by a tick as each technology get crossed out of the 35 Chokepoints List, as overcapacity cycles in synergistic industries phase-lock and tun into smooth capacity expansion… While on Earth, they do not expect to directly acquire much more land (though they opportunistically exploit whatever they can, and aim to monopolize much of the South China Sea), but they feel reasonably secure in their odds, relying on the gravity of their nascent industrial singularity to sway those fence-sitters who may be of help. 
> They might be wrong to feel this way, but that is how they feel. It's a cultural thing. They are unbearably arrogant in thinking they can do everything by themselves. In a world where Americans don't exist, they would be undeniably correct.  
> 
> Americans are swindlers, pirates and conquerors, expansionists by virtue of their selection and path dependency, driven by Manifest Destiny, Messianic even in their pacifist eras (nevermind Imperial ones), dreamers and innovators and sci-fi writers. They are vastly more aware of the stakes, they have thought about all of this in far greater resolution and on a higher strategic level, from reusable space launch and all the way to nanotechnology and Von Neumann probes. Soviets came up with the Kardashev scale as they tried to keep up, but it's the richest man in the world – obviously American – who's taking this idea most seriously of all. And they are panicking. Because they realize their hand is shit. Decayed industry, too few able bodies and brains, corrupt governance, misaligned capital allocation… But they believe that AI-driven automation can make up for the current industrial weakness, magnify their growth factor, get them back in the lead, and possibly entitle them to the entirety of the pie; and they would rather risk it all in a gamble than give up the hope of leaving nothing on the table. For now, they're scrambling to acquire raw inputs in perpetuity. It doesn't matter that most of Greenland is covered by an ice shield a mile thick. Where they see themselves going, it's no great obstacle. 
> Maybe they are deluded to have such priorities at this stage. They had already shot themselves in the foot with the compute blockade premised on singularity by ≈2025 – both ineptly executed, full of holes, and too early to really rug pull the Chinese. Maybe they are feeling too close to the prize again, because it's an old dream and waking up is painful. But that is how they feel, for they are who they are. 
> 
> Europeans are not thinking about this much if at all – to them «science fiction» reads like escapism at best and fascist ideation at worst. They were broken by two world wars and one cold one, their spirit sundered and ambitions cauterized, they got locked into an emasculating alliance with the strong, and then developed political systems more pathological than a third world kleptocracy, symbolically ruled by the weakest of the weak. Etc etc., Americans dunk on them incessantly. Nonetheless, the best of them are not *too stupid to get this*. If not the full stakes, then the mundane reality of what America is doing. It's not just trying to deny Greenland and Venezuela to China or (lmao) Russia. It's trying to deny their resources *to Venezuelans and Danes*, and eventually the same is to be done to Canadians and more peoples within reach, as per the Donroe Doctrine. That's why every effort to satisfy demands while saving face is dismissed with mockery, why no air base is good enough, no show of «Arctic resolve» passes the muster. You see, formalities actually matter. A legible and «legal» position is harder to rally up a coalition against, within and between states — that's why China fights so fiercely for non-recognition of Taiwan. So long as the legal owner can demand you vacate the premises, your own claim to squatting, backed by force alone, may be compromised, may come at a steeper cost. That's too bad. The US wants full ownership because it wants to strip assets of value all the way to the mantle. 
> 
> But those smart Europeans cannot really compel their compatriots to act on this grim realization. Can't even loudly talk of it. They are few and the cope is too strong. What could their pitch even be, realistically? Maybe something like:
> «The US is acting on a totally different theory of history. They are executing a coherent predatory Paperclip Maximizer logic and there is no bottom to what they might do. It is pointless to call them out on their bullshit, they are no longer sensitive to human speech. We need to drag out the inevitable loss of Greenland while assisting Americans to get bogged down in whatever can overstetch them from Israel to the Indo-Pacific to domestic unrest, curtail democracy, slash welfare, expel Atlanticist agents of influence, brutalize or deport non-assimilating immigrants, bump our defense and R&D spending to 15-20%, fortify remaining vulnerable outposts, coerce Ukraine into whatever peace is possible, reopen energy imports from Russia, have Rosatom build 50 nuclear reactors and France 5000 more nuclear warheads, generally put the French in charge instead of retarded Germanic cuckolds and schoolmarms, maximize tech transfer and capital goods imports from China even if we have to sell out ASML wholesale… and hope that the Western Civilization, of which only we remain true heirs and not obscene monsters, can secure a meagre stake in the future of Cosmos». Nah. That's not going to fly. It sounds deranged, there will be negative political will for it, and worst of all, it puts France in the limelight. A petty European peasant would rather eat shit than let the French become Main Characters of his continent's history. Europeans are very meticulous in cutting tall poppies around them. A fat, mockable, «cultureless», guns-n-bible overseas Hegemon is more tolerable than the insufferable, preening one next door. Except the hegemon is no longer fat since he went on the Danish Ozempic and Chinese peptides, and he's mortally dangerous. But they don't see it yet. No, no.
> 
> So they are forced to frame the response in terms aligned with the cope. We've just seen a rhetorical oscillation happen, from hints at actual European defense to… this. «We must demonstrate to our cherished, understandably worried partners that Europe is strong and can defend Greenland from Chyna&Russia! We'd whoop the asses of those bugs and orcs! It's not just dog sleds, we have real military and we totally can deploy it to the island!» This feels like Doing Something. This feels reassuring and non-scary. This can be done. Militarily, it's hopeless of course.  
> 
> Image
> However, it's not doomed. They assume – correctly – that America is made of many different interest groups also. And that the group represented by Mr. Trump needs wider buy-in for his special-grade Based actions, and likely will need far more after the midterms. So the obvious plan emerges: smile and wave, play for time, concede on non-vital issues, insist on this already disingenuous pretense of alliance, position at least some real forces, and give globalists and sincerely clueless China&Russia hawks in Washington a leg to stand on when they hamper Trump's effort to destroy NATO in the short term. Be so annoyingly nice and obliging as to make «the hard way» unpalatable to all but the most desperate cannibals. And diversify. Russia is suddenly a European country. China gets favorable trade deals and cooperation in the space program. Canada is scambling to act the same way, as Americans are botting up the pretext for «operation Alberta Freedom Eagle Burger» or whatever the fuck they'll call it. They may lose Alberta, but they want to keep something of a nation. That's what countries are, they are not economic platforms or random patches of land, but superorganisms with a telos, trying to survive in a condition of opportunistic anarchy that is the real world.

> > Survival means not perishing. To bring something from nothingness into existence is an extraordinary matter; to prevent existence from turning into nothingness is to survive. Therefore, only that which cannot perish can survive. The direct causes for a nation’s extinction may be enumerated, often involving specific means. As for the root of survival, it lies nowhere but in the unyielding and independent spirit of the nation and its people. If a nation cannot be lured by profit nor coerced by force, then it can survive in the world. Even if temporarily defeated, it can quickly rise again. Otherwise, though it may be called independent, its extinction is imminent. This is not mere theory. Whenever a nation’s people possess an unyielding and independent spirit, others find it beneficial to respect its independence. Even from calculations of international interest, they would not dare to lightly violate its independence. This can be proven by history and induced from contemporary facts.
> 
> > Belgium, pitted against Germany, can be said to be unable to hold out. Today the Belgian government is in Le Havre, and Belgian territory is reduced to a mere speck. However, not only does no one among the Allied Powers dare to say that Belgium can perish; even the neutral countries all hold a special respect for Belgium. The reason is that Belgium’s unyielding independent spirit has already proven it to be an indestructible nation. Even if today Belgium were to lose all its territory and its entire army captured, we can be certain that neutral countries would not thereby doubt Belgium’s existence. Why? Because Belgium’s people, territory, and sovereignty are founded upon this unyielding independent spirit; what is severed is form, what is unsevered is spirit. Even if Belgian territory perishes, it is as if it does not perish; even if its people die, it is as if they do not die. For Belgium was once forcibly annexed into Holland. But its people held a firm and unyielding determination, and thus ultimately regained their freedom and became an independent nation. Since the national character is such, others ultimately cannot subdue them; even if temporarily forced to yield by military might, it is insufficient to cause the nation’s extinction.
> 
> This had been said of the gentle Belgium, the seat of authority in our misbegotten European Union today.  
> Americans have done well to remind the rest of «the West» that they too are nations — in theory at least. Now the question is whether they can exist as nations in practice; whether they can find the will to be imperishable again. Otherwise, their condition is tantamount to extinction, just suspended — like death sentences of so many Chinese officials who had crossed the only power that matters in their world.

Below is a critical read of the thread as an argument (what it claims, how it persuades, what it gets right/wrong, and what would need to be true for it to hold). I’ll avoid repeating its slurs; they matter to the critique, but they don’t add analytical value.

## What this thread is responding to in the real world

The essay is framed around a *specific January 2026 transatlantic crisis*: reporting says President Donald Trump threatened escalating tariffs on multiple European allies unless the U.S. is allowed to purchase Greenland, and European states responded with small, symbolic troop deployments to Greenland (e.g., Germany deploying a 13-person reconnaissance team). ([Reuters][1])

So the “thirteen soldiers” punchline at the end is not invented: it’s pointing at a real, widely reported, deliberately modest deployment. ([AP News][2])

That context matters because it explains why the thread keeps circling Greenland/minerals/sovereignty and why it treats European “resolve” rhetoric as potentially performative.

## The thread’s core thesis in one sentence

It tries to reframe the Greenland crisis as *evidence of a coherent American predatory strategy driven by an “endgame” worldview*—a mix of resource extraction, AI automation, and long-horizon “spacefaring civilization” maximization—while claiming Europe is only slowly waking up to this and is mostly coping.

That thesis has two layers:

1. **Layer A (plausible):** alliances strain, resource security matters, the Trump administration is transactional/coercive, and Europe contains factions with different threat perceptions.

2. **Layer B (speculative/unsupported):** U.S. actions are best explained by a quasi-longtermist “Paperclip Maximizer” logic aimed at cosmic-scale resource capture.

Layer A can be analyzed with normal geopolitics. Layer B is where the argument becomes much shakier.

## What the thread gets right (or at least plausibly right)

### 1) Europe’s interests are not uniform

It is true (in a broad sense) that countries close to Russia tend to prioritize NATO/US security guarantees more intensely than countries farther away. This is a standard, mainstream observation in European security politics.

### 2) The Greenland story really does involve “hard” interests, not just vibes

Greenland has significant critical mineral potential, and it has also been politically contentious to develop—especially where rare earths are co-located with uranium, which Greenland banned again in 2021 (and the ban’s future has been a live political/economic issue). ([Atlantic Council][3])

That reality weakens simplistic “just mine it tomorrow” fantasies, but it strengthens the narrower claim that Greenland is not *only* about identity or symbolism.

### 3) “Venezuela has ~300B barrels” is basically correct as a headline number

Venezuela is widely reported (including by the U.S. EIA) as having ~303 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves. ([U.S. Energy Information Administration][4])
The thread’s “300 billion barrels” line is in the right ballpark, even if its “Delta Force go go go” framing is obviously rhetorical.

### 4) China’s industrial scale is enormous (but the thread overstates it)

A strong, fact-based version of the thread’s point is: China is the world’s largest manufacturing economy by value added and exceeds the next few countries combined. CSIS’s ChinaPower project puts China at **~28%** of global manufacturing value added in 2023. ([ChinaPower Project][5])
That is *huge*, but it is not “50% of all the stuff.”

### 5) China does have serious lunar/space-power ambitions (though not as cleanly as the thread implies)

Reuters has reported on plans for a China-led lunar base concept that includes **nuclear power** and solar arrays for the International Lunar Research Station concept. ([Reuters][6])
There are also official and semi-official discussions of **space-based solar power** ambitions (e.g., Xinhua reporting CAST plans), though timelines and feasibility are debated. ([Xinhua News][7])

## Where the thread is weakest (and why)

### 1) It repeatedly jumps from *observations* to *a single hidden cause*

The essay offers examples (Greenland, Venezuela, Taiwan/TSMC, rare earths) and then asserts: “there is one underlying logic, and it’s consistent.”

This is an attractive narrative move, but analytically it’s a leap. The same surface facts can fit multiple explanations:

* domestic politics / signaling / coercive bargaining,
* classic great-power competition (Arctic posture; sea lanes; basing),
* industrial policy and supply-chain security,
* ideology and grievance politics,
* bureaucratic momentum and factional policy fights.

A serious case for the thread’s “one coherent strategy” would need:

* internal documents, consistent policy across agencies, budgets, directives, etc.
* continuity across time and administrations (or a clear mechanism for sudden alignment).

The thread doesn’t provide that. It mainly supplies a *story that feels coherent*.

### 2) “Some tech elites think in cosmic terms” ≠ “America is doing this”

It names Musk/Thiel/Karp/Matheny and claims “this is what the Americans believe.”

Even if we grant part of this—that some tech leaders publicly discuss long-horizon futures, existential risk, space settlement, and civilizational stakes (Musk’s multi-planet framing is explicit) ([Aeon][8])—it still doesn’t follow that:

* this is a shared belief of “America,” or
* this worldview is the primary driver of U.S. state behavior, or
* it explains specific tariff/coercion decisions better than nearer-term incentives.

This is a classic **composition fallacy**: taking a subset’s ideology and treating it as the system’s motive.

### 3) The automation timeline is asserted with maximal confidence against mainstream evidence

The thread claims essentially: “full human labor automation within at most a generation, maybe a few years.”

Mainstream assessments are far more cautious and emphasize *task exposure, partial automation, and augmentation*, not near-term “full automation.” For example:

* The ILO’s task-level work treats generative AI impacts in terms of exposure gradients and partial task transformation, not wholesale replacement in a few years. ([International Labour Organization][9])
* MIT Sloan work similarly distinguishes automation from augmentation and stresses how often AI complements work rather than fully replaces occupations. ([MIT Sloan][10])
* Even aggressive business estimates often talk about sizable portions of activities by 2030—not “everything in a few years.” ([McKinsey & Company][11])

So the thread’s timeline is less “bold” than “unmoored.”

### 4) It overstates material constraints in a way that undercuts its own story

If the argument is “we’re close to godlike automation + spacefaring capability,” then it becomes *less* obvious that annexing Greenland is a rational necessity. With that level of capability, the binding constraints would likely be:

* energy,
* launch/transport capacity,
* precision manufacturing,
* governance/security against sabotage,
* and—ironically—**avoiding destabilizing conflict** that disrupts everything.

In other words, the more you buy the “endgame tech” premise, the less convincing “therefore seize Greenland” becomes, because space resources and asteroid mining would eventually dwarf terrestrial rare earth deposits, and because political blowback becomes a key risk.

The thread doesn’t resolve this tension; it handwaves it away (“ice is no obstacle where we’re going”).

### 5) Its prescriptions are intentionally “insane-sounding” and often physically/politically implausible

The thread itself admits its radical “pitch” wouldn’t fly. But note how extreme the numbers are:

* **15–20% of GDP** defense/R&D is far beyond current European norms and even beyond NATO’s newer, much lower benchmark paths (reporting notes talk of a 5% target by 2035). ([Reuters][12])
* **France “5000 more nuclear warheads”** is fantasy relative to France’s estimated stockpile (~290 warheads). ([Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists][13])

This matters because it signals that the thread is not trying to propose an implementable program; it’s trying to *shock*, *polarize*, and *reframe*.

## The thread’s persuasion techniques (and how they shape reader belief)

### 1) Degradation and dehumanization as social sorting

Ableist slurs, contempt for whole nationalities, sexualized insults, and “bugs/orcs” language do rhetorical work: they create an in‑group of “people who see the Real Game” and an out‑group of moral/political inferiors.

This is effective for mobilization, but it’s a reliability red flag: it biases the author toward **performative certainty** and away from falsifiable claims.

### 2) “Directionally true” as preemptive armor

Saying “heavily narrativized but directionally true” is a clever hedge: it asks readers to excuse inaccuracies as long as the *vibe* seems right. That’s the opposite of how you’d write if you wanted your model tested.

### 3) High-status technical language to simulate rigor

“Steradians of the light cone,” “negentropy,” “event horizon,” etc. gives the sensation of deep analytical grounding. But it’s not doing measurable explanatory work for the specific policy claims about tariffs, NATO, or Greenland.

It’s **aesthetic rigor**: it feels like physics, but functions like myth-making.

### 4) Motive attribution without evidence

A large share of the essay is: “X group believes Y,” “Z faction wants W,” “Europe is coping,” “Americans are panicking.”

Those are psychological claims. The thread offers almost no direct evidence (documents, statements, revealed preferences, internal deliberations) for them. The writing style substitutes confidence for proof.

| Sun Yat‑sen 1917 quote about national survival             | The quoted Chinese text is traceable in Sun Yat‑sen archival material. ([Sunology][16])                                               | The thread uses it as moral framing; it doesn’t validate the earlier causal story.             |

## A “best version” reinterpretation that doesn’t require the cosmic conspiracy

If you want to salvage the thread into something analytically defensible, you can translate it into testable claims like:

* **U.S. policy under Trump is more openly coercive/transactional toward allies**, and Greenland is a flashpoint demonstrating that. ([Reuters][1])
* **Critical minerals and supply-chain security are increasingly central** to great-power competition, and Greenland’s mineral potential is part of that. ([CSIS][14])
* **Europe will hedge**: symbolically signal resolve, try to buy time, and diversify partnerships where possible.

Those may or may not be correct—but they can be argued with evidence (budgets, trade data, military posture, EU industrial policy, alliance statements). They don’t require assuming that the U.S. state is consciously optimizing for “negentropy within the event horizon.”

## If you’re analyzing it as rhetoric (rather than truth), what it’s “for”

This is not written to persuade skeptics. It’s written to:

* humiliate an out-group,
* flatter an in-group as “the only realists,”
* provide a totalizing explanation that converts messy politics into a single plotline,
* and leave the reader with a grim “national survival” moral.

That’s why it swings between concrete facts (13 soldiers) and cosmic metaphysics: the facts anchor the reader, the metaphysics monopolize interpretation.

---

If you want, I can also do a second pass that focuses narrowly on **(a) what it assumes about NATO deterrence and Russian incentives**, and **(b) what it assumes about resource economics in Greenland/Ukraine/Venezuela**, because those are the two most “falsifiable” pillars.
