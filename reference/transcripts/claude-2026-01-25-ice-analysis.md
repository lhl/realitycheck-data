> Can you do your own analysis on sources etc and see how you'd augment, modify or contradict any of the claims, evidence, credence etc. 

# Independent fact-check: ICE enforcement powers and Minnesota incidents

The ten claims under review vary significantly in accuracy. **Five claims warrant increased credence ratings** based on documented evidence, while two are appropriately rated and three require nuanced modification. The most significant finding: the Minnesota incidents are extensively documented with video evidence that frequently contradicts official DHS accounts, suggesting the original credence ratings systematically underweight evidence of enforcement abuses while appropriately treating extreme claims skeptically.

## GOV-2026-033: Administrative warrants for home entry

**Original credence: 0.90 | Recommended: 0.92 | Verdict: VERIFIED**

The May 12, 2025 ICE memo exists and makes precisely this claim. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons wrote to "All ICE Personnel" that "the DHS Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants" for home entry. The memo explicitly acknowledges this represents "a change from past procedures."

**8 CFR 287.8(f)(2)** states officers may not enter residences "unless the officer has either a warrant or the consent of the owner." The regulation does not specify judicial warrants, creating the ambiguity ICE exploits. However, ICE's own historical training materials confirm "administrative warrants do not authorize entry into a dwelling without consent." Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) documentation reinforces this interpretation.

**Courts have directly contradicted the memo.** On January 17, 2026, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled in the Gibson case that ICE violated the Fourth Amendment when agents used a battering ram to enter Garrison Gibson's Minneapolis home with only an I-205 administrative warrant. Judge Bryan found this "arrest violated the Fourth Amendment" and ordered immediate release. In *Kidd v. Mayorkas* (2024), Judge Wright ruled administrative warrants "lack the independent assurance guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment."

Stanford Law Professor Orin Kerr assessed the memo as "likely wrong in light of *Coolidge*, *Shadwick*, and *Payton*" but acknowledged the position is "not frivolous" given *Abel v. United States* (1960). The **0.90 credence is appropriate**—the memo exists and ICE is acting on it, though courts have ruled against the practice when challenged.

## GOV-2026-034: Registration document requirements

**Original credence: 0.95 | Recommended: 0.98 | Verdict: FULLY VERIFIED**

**8 U.S.C. § 1304(e)** states exactly: "Every alien, eighteen years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him." Violation is a misdemeanor punishable by up to $100 fine or 30 days imprisonment.

The statute's existence and enforcement are not in dispute. The **0.95 credence should be increased to 0.98**—this is established, black-letter law currently being enforced. The only uncertainty concerns whether recent Federal Register rulemaking (90 FR 11406, March 2025) has effectively increased penalties beyond the statutory $100 maximum.

---

## GOV-2026-035: Biometrics over paper documents

**Original credence: 0.55 | Recommended: 0.75 | Verdict: UNDERRATED**

The claim has stronger evidentiary support than the credence suggests. ICE deploys CBP's "Mobile Fortify" smartphone application that photographs anyone encountered during field operations and runs facial recognition against **200+ million images** in CBP's Traveler Verification Service. A February 2025 Privacy Threshold Analysis confirms "ICE does not provide the opportunity for individuals to decline or consent to the collection."

Representative Bennie Thompson, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, stated: "ICE officials have told us that an apparent biometric match by Mobile Fortify is a 'definitive' determination of a person's status and that an ICE officer may ignore evidence of American citizenship—**including a birth certificate**—if the app says the person is an alien." Photos are retained for 15 years regardless of citizenship status.

This claim warrants **0.75 credence**. Congressional testimony and official privacy documents establish that biometric primacy is policy, not merely isolated incidents.

## GOV-2026-036: Broad detention including children; citizen errors

**Original credence: 0.65 | Recommended: 0.90 | Verdict: SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERRATED**

This claim is extensively documented across multiple independent sources.

**Minnesota child detention cases (January 2026):**
- **Liam Conejo Ramos (age 5)**: Detained January 20-21 in Columbia Heights driveway with father. Now held at Dilley, Texas. Family had active asylum case with no deportation order.
- **Chloe Tipan Villacis (age 2)**: Detained January 23 during traffic stop. Federal Judge Menendez ordered release by 9:30 PM; **ICE flew her to Texas at 8:30 PM despite the court order**.
- At least **9 children** total detained in January 2026 per court records, including a 10-year-old on her way to school.

**US citizen detention is systematically documented:**
- ProPublica investigation (October 2025): **170+ US citizens** detained during first nine months of second Trump administration
- Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (December 2025): 22 detailed cases including Javier Ramirez (diabetic, had passport in pocket, held 96+ hours), George Retes (Army veteran, held 3 days), Julian Cardenas (developed PTSD after head slammed, charges dismissed)
- GAO historical data (FY2015-2020): 674 potential citizens arrested, 121 detained, **70 deported**
- Nearly **20 US citizen children** documented among detention cases

The **0.65 credence significantly underrates** evidence quality. This warrants **0.90 credence**—child detention and citizen errors are not theoretical risks but documented, ongoing occurrences.

## GOV-2026-037: Indefinite detention without lawyer access

**Original credence: 0.20 | Recommended: 0.25 | Verdict: APPROPRIATELY LOW**

The extreme version of this claim is legally incorrect but practical barriers are real.

**Legal framework prevents truly indefinite detention:**
- *Zadvydas v. Davis* (2001): Supreme Court established **6 months as presumptively reasonable** detention after removal order
- After 6 months, if alien demonstrates "no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future," release is required
- *Clark v. Martinez* (2005) extended these protections to inadmissible aliens

However, *Jennings v. Rodriguez* (2018) held that statutes **do not require** periodic bond hearings during detention, meaning prolonged detention without review can occur.

**Counsel access barriers are severe but not absolute:**
- **8 U.S.C. § 1362** provides only "the privilege" of representation "at no expense to the Government"—not appointed counsel
- **80% of detained immigrants** are unrepresented
- 58+ facilities don't allow scheduled attorney calls; 85% charge detained persons for calls to lawyers
- Release rate dropped from 26% (October 2024) to **3%** (September 2025)

The claim overstates by implying total denial of counsel and indefinite detention. Credence of **0.20-0.25 is appropriate**—the literal claim is incorrect, but practical access barriers are extreme.

## GOV-2026-038: No meaningful "day in court"

**Original credence: 0.45 | Recommended: 0.55 | Verdict: SLIGHTLY UNDERRATED**

This claim requires pathway-specific analysis. Evidence supports increased credence.

**Expedited removal expansion (January 2025):**
- Executive Order 14159 expanded expedited removal to anyone present continuously **less than 2 years, anywhere in the United States** (previously 14 days within 100 miles of border)
- Under expedited removal, individuals receive **no immigration judge hearing**—only an asylum officer interview if they claim fear of persecution
- May 2023-March 2024: **316,000 migrants** processed via expedited removal—more than any prior full fiscal year
- FY 2022-2024: Expedited removal exceeded **half of all removals**

**Thuraissigiam impact:**
*DHS v. Thuraissigiam* (2020) held that limited habeas review for expedited removal "does not violate the Suspension or Due Process Clauses." Those apprehended at the border have "limited due process rights."

**Immigration court for those who reach it:**
- **3.4 million** cases pending; average wait **636 days**
- Only **23.7%** have attorney assistance when removal orders issued
- September 2025: **79%** of completed cases resulted in deportation orders

The mixed evidence supports **0.55 credence**—many encounter no court, and those who do face severe disadvantages, but formal hearings do occur for substantial numbers.

## GOV-2026-039: Third-country deportations on short notice

**Original credence: 0.85 | Recommended: 0.92 | Verdict: VERIFIED, SLIGHTLY UNDERRATED**

Deportations to third countries are extensively documented.

**El Salvador CECOT deportations:**
- March 15, 2025: First flights—approximately **261 alleged gang members** deported
- Total sent: **280+ men** by April 2025
- Administration paid El Salvador approximately **$6 million** to hold 300 prisoners
- CECOT conditions documented by Human Rights Watch, 60 Minutes, and CNN: no family visits, no counsel access, cramped cells, reports of torture

**South Sudan deportations confirmed:**
- May 19-20, 2025: 6 class members removed with **less than 16 hours' notice**
- July 4, 2025: 8 individuals deported including persons from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, and Vietnam with no connection to South Sudan
- State Department warning: South Sudan has "Do Not Travel" advisory due to "crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict"

**Supreme Court orders:**
- June 23, 2025: Unsigned order stayed preliminary injunction requiring 15-day notice
- Effect: Allowed resumption of third-country deportations with minimal notice
- Dissent (Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson): "The Government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law"

Libya removals were **attempted but blocked** by Judge Murphy's May 7, 2025 emergency order.

The **0.85 credence is appropriate but could be 0.92**—these deportations are documented fact with Supreme Court sanction.

---

## GOV-2026-040: Mistakes cannot be reversed

**Original credence: 0.55 | Recommended: 0.50 | Verdict: MIXED EVIDENCE**

The administration made "powerless to return" claims, but subsequent events complicated the picture.

**Abrego Garcia case facts:**
- Kilmar Abrego Garcia had **express withholding of removal order** (2019) prohibiting deportation to El Salvador
- No criminal record in any country
- March 15, 2025: ICE arrested and deported him to CECOT
- March 31, 2025: DOJ attorney acknowledged "administrative error"—"should not have been removed"

**"Powerless" claims documented:**
- DHS General Counsel declaration: "DHS does not have authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation"
- Stephen Miller: "If [Bukele] were to return [Abrego Garcia], he would be deported the second time"
- Trump (ABC interview): When told "You could get him back," replied "I could" but refused

**ICE Directive 11061.1** establishes policy to "facilitate [an] alien's return to the United States if...the alien's presence is necessary for continued administrative removal proceedings." Justice Sotomayor cited this in her April 10, 2025 concurrence.

**Subsequent development:** Abrego Garcia **was returned** to the US—but for prosecution on alleged migrant transportation charges, not release. He remains in ICE detention.

The **0.55 credence is appropriate**—the administration claimed powerlessness but this was contradicted by its own policy and subsequent action. The claim captures rhetorical posture more than operational reality.

---

## GOV-2026-041: Shooting for "interference" justified as terrorism

**Original credence: 0.15 | Recommended: 0.20 | Verdict: APPROPRIATELY LOW**

Official deadly force policy contradicts the extreme claim, but rhetoric narrows the gap.

**8 CFR 287.8(a)(2) requires:**
Deadly force "may be used only when a designated immigration officer has reasonable grounds to believe that such force is necessary to protect...from the **imminent danger of death or serious physical injury**." This is a narrow standard—interference alone does not qualify.

**Rhetoric expansion documented:**
- DHS Secretary Noem (July 2025): "Violence is anything that threatens them...it is doxing them. It's **videotaping them** where they're at when they're out on operations"
- DHS statement to *Reason*: Following and recording officers "sure sounds like obstruction of justice...we will hunt you down"
- Maine ICE agent (January 23, 2026): Told legal observer filming, "you're considered a domestic terrorist"

**The two Minnesota shootings** involved disputed facts about threat levels, with video evidence contradicting official "imminent danger" claims in both cases. However, neither shooting was officially justified as response to "interference" alone—DHS claimed vehicle threat (Good) and armed approach (Pretti).

The **0.15-0.20 credence is appropriate**. The literal claim (shooting people for interference, calling it terrorism) overstates operational policy, but the rhetorical conflation of filming/observing with "violence" and "domestic terrorism" is documented and concerning.

## GOV-2026-042: "Domestic terrorist" labeling by leadership

**Original credence: 0.75 | Recommended: 0.90 | Verdict: VERIFIED, UNDERRATED**

This claim is extensively documented with direct quotes.

**Secretary Noem statements:**
- On Renee Good (January 7, 2026): Called her actions "an act of domestic terrorism" the same day she was killed
- On Alex Pretti (January 24, 2026): Called incident "domestic terrorism" and stated "this looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage"
- General definition (January 24): "When you perpetuate violence against a government because of ideological reasons...that is the definition of domestic terrorism"

**Other officials:**
- Stephen Miller (January 24, 2026): Called Pretti a "domestic terrorist" who "tried to assassinate federal law enforcement"—hours after the shooting, before investigation
- Maine ICE agent (January 23, 2026, on video): Told legal observer "you're considered a domestic terrorist"

**Context of Good and Pretti:**
- Renee Good: 37-year-old US citizen, mother of three, shot while video shows her attempting to drive away (not toward) agent
- Alex Pretti: 37-year-old ICU nurse at Minneapolis VA; video evidence shows he was recording with phone, not brandishing gun; Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus stated he "had been disarmed seconds before" shots were fired

DHS spokesperson McLaughlin denied a "domestic terrorist database" exists, but the Maine video shows an agent explicitly referencing one.

The **0.75 credence underrates** the documentation quality. Direct quotes from the DHS Secretary, White House advisor, and field agents—many on video—warrant **0.90 credence**.

## Minnesota incidents: January 2026

### Renee Good shooting (January 7, 2026)

**What is verified:**
- Time/location: 9:27-9:42 AM, Portland Avenue, south Minneapolis
- Victim: Renee Nicole Good, 37, US citizen, mother of three
- Shooter: ICE agent Jonathan Ross (10-year ICE veteran)
- Outcome: Three shots fired; Good died approximately one hour later

**DHS account:** Good ignored commands, tried to "weaponize her vehicle" to run over an officer; agent struck and hospitalized.

**Contradicting evidence:** Multiple news organizations reviewed video. Mayor Jacob Frey stated: "Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly **that is bullshit**." Video analysis shows vehicle turning away from, not toward, the agent when shots were fired. Good was monitoring ICE activity as part of community alert networks.

**Key dispute:** Whether vehicle struck agent; whether Good was fleeing or attacking.

### Alex Pretti shooting (January 24, 2026)

**What is verified:**
- Time/location: 9:05 AM, 26th Street West and Nicollet Avenue
- Victim: Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, US citizen, ICU nurse at Minneapolis VA
- Shooter: Border Patrol agent (not ICE)
- Outcome: At least 10 shots; Pretti died at scene

**DHS account:** Pretti "approached Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun," "violently resisted" disarming.

**Contradicting evidence:** Videos verified by NYT, CBS, Reuters show Pretti holding cellphone, left hand appeared empty. An agent is visible reaching into scuffle empty-handed and backing away holding gun—consistent with removing gun from Pretti's person before shots fired. Sworn witness declarations state: "The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera."

**Gun recovery timeline:** Minneapolis Police confirmed Pretti was lawful gun owner with valid permit. Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus stated "at the time that the shots were fired he had been disarmed seconds before."

### Federal court ruling (January 17, 2026)

Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled ICE violated Fourth Amendment in Garrison Gibson case. Gibson, a Liberian citizen with no criminal record (contradicting DHS claim of "lengthy rap sheet") who had lived in US 30+ years and was on Order of Supervision, was subjected to battering-ram entry with only administrative warrant. Gibson was released, re-arrested the next day at routine check-in, then released again.

### Child detention cases

- **5-year-old Liam**: School board chair Mary Granlund witnessed agents allegedly "using a 5-year-old as bait," directing him to knock on door. Superintendent Stenvik documented this in public statements.
- **2-year-old Chloe**: ICE flew child to Texas despite federal judge's order for release, timing flight departure (8:30 PM) before deadline (9:30 PM).

## JD Vance "absolute immunity" claims

**What Vance said (January 8, 2026):** "That guy is protected by absolute immunity. He was doing his job."

**Walk-back (January 22, 2026):** "I didn't say—and I don't think any other official within the Trump administration said that officers who engaged in wrongdoing would enjoy immunity."

**Legal reality:** No such blanket immunity exists. *Drury v. Lewis* (1906) established federal officials can face state prosecution when conduct exceeds "necessary and proper" official duties. Legal scholars called Vance's original claim "farcical."

---

## Evidence level assessment

The original claims generally used appropriate evidence levels but systematically underweighted:
1. **Video evidence** contradicting official accounts (Good and Pretti shootings)
2. **Congressional investigations** documenting citizen detention (Senate PSI report)
3. **Court findings** contradicting DHS claims (Gibson "no criminal record" vs DHS "lengthy rap sheet")
4. **Direct official quotes** on "domestic terrorism" labeling

The most significant corrections involve claims where documented incidents (E5-E6 level evidence: official records, video, court filings) were treated as if supported only by lower-quality sources. The original credence ratings showed appropriate skepticism toward extreme claims (0.15-0.20 for shooting/terrorist justification) but insufficient weight to extensively documented enforcement practices.
