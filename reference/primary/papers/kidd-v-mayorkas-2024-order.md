Kidd v. Mayorkas (C.D. Cal.) — Order on Motions for Summary Judgment (05/15/2024) (PDF)

---

Selected excerpts (verbatim from PDF text extraction):

Neither a Warrant for Arrest of Alien (I-200) nor a Warrant of Removal (I-205) authorizes officers to enter the target’s residence or anywhere else where the target has a reasonable expectation of privacy. A government intrusion into an area where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy for the purpose of gathering information will trigger Fourth Amendment protections, including a physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area . . . . Therefore, without a criminal warrant, officers must obtain voluntary consent before entering a residence or area where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.

The Court therefore agrees with this position and finds that the warrant requirements under the Fourth Amendment apply to 8 C.F.R. § 287.8(f)(2), which, as discussed previously, require a judicial warrant to enter a home or its curtilage under the Fourth Amendment.
