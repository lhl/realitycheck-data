Selected excerpts (verbatim from PDF text extraction; redactions preserved):

ICE does not provide the opportunity for individuals to decline or consent to the collection and
use of biometric data/photograph collection.

How long is information stored or retained? If the data is stored in multiple places, please
provide the information for all locations. Please describe below and indicate retention
schedules if applicable.
Every new photograph or fingerprint, regardless of match, is an encounter and
stored and retained in ATS for 15 years.

Although the intended purpose of the Mobile Fortify Application is to identify aliens who are
removable from the United States, users may use Mobile Fortify to collect information in
identifiable form about individuals regardless of citizenship or immigration status. It is
conceivable that a photo taken by an agent using the Mobile Fortify mobile application could be
that of someone other than an alien, including U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
Therefore a PIA is required pursuant to the E-Government Act.

The Mobile Fortify mobile application does not retain or store any information locally. However,
CBP will retain all photographs, including the non-match photographs (to include U.S.
citizens / LPR photographs), as part of ATS holdings consistent with its published ATS PIA and
SORN.
