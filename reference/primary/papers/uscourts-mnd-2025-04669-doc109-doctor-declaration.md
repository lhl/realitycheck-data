Selected excerpts (manual transcription from the scanned PDF; verify against the source PDF for absolute fidelity):

“Over the noise, I informed the ICE agents that I am a physician, and I asked to assess the victim.”

“But none of the ICE agents who were near the victim were performing CPR, and I could tell that the victim was in critical condition.”

“As I approached, I saw that the victim was lying on his side and was surrounded by several ICE agents. I was confused as to why the victim was on his side, because that is not standard practice when a victim has been shot. Checking for a pulse and administering CPR is standard practice. Instead of doing either of those things, the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds.”

“I asked the ICE agents if the victim had a pulse, and they said they did not know.”

“The victim had at least three bullet wounds in his back. … I saw an additional gunshot wound on the victim’s upper left chest and another possible gunshot wound on his neck.”

“I checked for a pulse, but I did not feel one. I immediately began CPR. Shortly after I started compressions, EMS personnel arrived and took over.”
