Selected excerpts (verbatim from PDF text extraction):

Introduction (excerpt):

This is the first launch we are treating as High capability in the Cybersecurity domain under our
Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards.

…

We do not have definitive evidence that this model reaches our High threshold, but are taking a
precautionary approach because we cannot rule out the possibility that it may be capable enough to
reach the threshold.

Agent sandbox (excerpt):

When using Codex in the cloud, the agent runs with access to an isolated container hosted by
OpenAI, effectively its own computer with network access disabled by default.

Network access (excerpt):

We enable users to decide on a per-project basis which sites, if any, to let the agent access while it
is running. This includes the ability to provide a custom allowlist or denylist.

Sandbagging (Apollo Research) (excerpt):

Apollo reports that the model demonstrates strong sabotage capabilities. In their sabotage suite,
Apollo reports a mean best-of-10 score of 0.88 (max 1.00), compared to 0.75 for GPT-5.2 and 0.66
for GPT-5.2 Codex.

Compaction / long horizons (excerpt):

GPT-5.3-Codex leverages compaction, enabling sustained, coherent progress across long horizons.

Long-range autonomy measurement (excerpt):

Strengthening our ability to measure long-range autonomy (LRA): Our existing
preparedness evaluations assess our models under production-like harnesses, including using
compaction to elicit and assess agentic performance over longer time horizons than would
otherwise be possible. We do not currently have robust evaluations and thresholding for
long-range autonomy and have had to lean on proxy evaluations (e.g. TerminalBench) for
understanding capabilities related to LRA.

Preparedness wording clarification (excerpt):

Our intended meaning, which we will make more explicit in
future versions of the Preparedness Framework, is that such safeguards are needed when High
cyber capability occurs “in conjunction with” long-range autonomy.

External government testing (CAISI) (excerpt):

CAISI observed
that GPT-5.3-Codex continued making meaningful progress on difficult cyber tasks across many
compaction windows, finding novel results even after 50M or more unique tokens and tens of
hours of analysis.
