## Post Text (verbatim)

China's $1.189 trillion trade surplus looks like strength.

It's the signature of collapse.

Exports +5.5%
Imports +0%

The surplus isn't foreign demand pulling goods out. It's domestic demand evaporating so completely that factories dump production globally at any price that clears.

No economy in recorded history has sustained 5% growth through 10 consecutive quarters of deflation.

Rhodium estimates actual growth at 2.5-3%—half the official claim.

The recognition catalyst arrives in days.

Vanke—the "safe" state-backed developer everyone thought had implicit government support—faces RMB 9.4 billion in bond maturities.

Bondholders rejected a one-year extension: 78.3%

Shenzhen Metro, the state-owned backstop, just issued this statement:

Support has "surpassed its risk comfort zone."

Cannot provide "unlimited guarantees."

The backstop just told you there is no backstop.

January 22
January 27
February 10

Three dates. Three bond deadlines. One forced recognition.

$4 trillion in China-exposed global assets was allocated based on an assumption the data no longer supports.

The bondholders already know.

The allocators discover it next.
