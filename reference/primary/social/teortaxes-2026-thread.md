The West is split between 3 extremist cults, 2 of them specific to the US.

The SV cult believes that a handful (~10k?) of self anointed "tech geniuses" (specifically themselves) + AGI will obsolete the rest of humanity within the next 10 years (previously 2027).

The Liberal Globalists believe in global unification under Liberalism.

MAGA believes in American primacy through force and coercion.

Each of these cults fundamentally promise that a small elite will either obsolete/replace or enslave/colonize rest of humanity.

The main disagreement is over the composition of that small elite destined to rule the world.

To restate the argument in more obvious terms.
The eventual end state of labor under automation has been understood by smart men (ie not shallow libshits) for ≈160 years since Darwin Among the Machines. The timeline to full automation was unclear. Technocrats and some Marxists expected it in the 20th century.
The last 14 years in AI (since connectionism won the hardware lottery as evidenced by AlexNet) match models that predict post-labor economy by 2035-2045. Vinge, Legg, Kurzweil, Moravec and others were unclear on details but it's obvious that if you showed them the present snapshot in say 1999, they'd have said «wow, yep, this is the endgame, almost all HARD puzzle pieces are placed».
The current technological stack is almost certainly not the final one. That doesn't matter. It will clearly suffice to build everything needed for a rapid transition to the next one – data, software, hardware, and it looks extremely dubious that the final human-made stack will be paradigmatically much more complex than what we've done in these 14 years.
Post-labor economy = post-consumer market = permanent underclass for virtually everyone and state-oligarchic power centralization by default. 
As an aside: «AI takeover» as an alternative scenario is cope for nihilists and red herring for autistic quokkas. Optimizing for compliance will be easier and ultimately more incentivized than optimizing for novel cognitive work.  There will be a decidedly simian ruling class, though it may choose to *become* something else. But that's not our business anon. We won't have much business at all.  
The serious business will be about the technocapital deepening and gradually expanding beyond Earth.
Frantic attempts to «escape the permanent underclass» in this community are not so much about getting rich as about converting wealth into some equity, a permanent stake in the ballooning posthuman economy, large enough that you'd at least be treading water on dividends, in the best case – large enough that it can sustain a thin, disciplined bloodline in perpetuity.
Current datacenter buildup effects and PC hardware prices are suggestive of where it's going. Consumers are getting priced out of everything valuable for industrial production, starting from the top (microchips) and the bottom (raw inputs like copper and electricity). The two shockwaves will be traveling closer to the middle. This is not so much a "supercycle" as a secular trend. 
American resource frenzy and disregard for diplomacy can be interpreted as a state-level reaction to this understanding.
There certainly are other factors, hedges for longer timelines, institutional inertia and disagreement between actors that prevents truly desperate focus on the new paradigm. But the smart people near the levers of power in the US do think in these terms.
Speaking purely of the political instinct, I think the quality of US elite is very high, and they're ahead of the curve, thus there are even different American cliques who have coherent positions on the issue. Other global elites, including the Chinese one, are slower on the uptake. But this state of affairs isn't as permanent as the underclass will be. 

For people who are not BOTH extremely smart and agentic – myself included – I don't have a solution that doesn't sound hopelessly romantic and naive.

My view is that the Americans believe this because interest payments on US debt is now growing at a rate that very hard decisions will soon have to be made (2027-2030 timeframe).

There needs to be a reset one way or another for the US.

it is plausible for me that the AGI timelines of American tech/political elites are biased by wishful thinking. Because longer timelines would imply they simply have NO moves left to secure their maximalist LiGhTCoNE objectives, and their civilization was straight up a bad bet.
