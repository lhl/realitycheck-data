## Post text (verbatim)

Positions ICE has taken:

- We can enter your home without a warrant
- You must carry your papers at all times
- But we can ignore them and only our scanner matters
- We can detain you anywhere, no matter your age, situation or status
- Indefinitely with no access to a lawyer
- And basically no right to a day in court
- We can send you to a third world prison if we choose
- But we can’t bring you back if we made a mistake
- And if you interfere with any of this we can shoot you because you are a terrorist

How is this not a recipe for totalitarianism?
