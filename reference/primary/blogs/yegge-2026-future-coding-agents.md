The Future of Coding Agents

Everyone seems to think that the future of coding agents is… coding agents. (...) when work needs to be done, nature prefers colonies. Nature builds ant colonies, (...) while Claude Code is “the world’s biggest fuckin’ ant.”

(...)

So my prediction here is that coding agents are very soon going to shift focus to be better colony workers. They need to have direct, built-in support for the emerging “Orchestrator API Surface”, (...)

(...)

I think big companies are going to be screwed. Really screwed. The form factor is starting to be wrong. It’s too many people to accomplish too little work. (...) The entire world is going to explode into tiny companies, which will then aggregate and re-form into larger ones… but not until we go through at least a year of churn, where small shops dramatically outperform large ones, to a degree we’ve never seen in all history.

(...)

Level 7+ users are already reporting that Gas Town is fun. Which it is! Once it gets on a roll for you, and it starts plowing through giant piles of heavily-reviewed, heavily-tested work, day after day, you’ll realize, wow. This is it. There’s no going back. We’ve arrived at factory farming code. And it’s hella fun.
