It’s been a busy 12 days since I launched Gas Town. (...) I’ve merged over 100 PRs from nearly 50 contributors, adding 44k lines of code that no human has looked at. This has grown Gas Town’s total size to 189k lines of Go code since its first commit on Dec 15th, which is now 2684 commits ago.

(...)

There was the Gas Town Serial Killer Murder Mystery (...) It was cleaning up “stale” workers that weren’t stale and murdering entire crews mid-task. (...) And we’ve had workers stalling out, getting lost, orphaned, confused about who they are. And no shortage of heresies: compelling but wrong beliefs about the architecture that spread invisibly. Heresies happen regularly when you’re coding blind.

(...)

You can use Polecats without the Refinery and even without the Witness or Deacon. Just tell the Mayor to shut down the rig and sling work to the polecats with the message that they are to merge to main directly. Or the polecats can submit MRs and then the Mayor can merge them manually. It’s really up to you.

(...)

Don’t watch your agents work. (...) When you see that an agent is finished working, stop everything, ignore everyone else, and read what it has to say. (...) Spend your time reading agent responses and giving them direction — not watching them work.
