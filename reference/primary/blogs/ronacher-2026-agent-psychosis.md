Agent Psychosis: Are We Going Insane?

Many of us got hit by the agent coding addiction. It feels good, we barely sleep, we build amazing things. Every once in a while that interaction involves other humans, and all of a sudden we get a reality check that maybe we overdid it. The most obvious example of this is the massive degradation of quality of issue reports and pull requests. As a maintainer many PRs now look like an insult to one’s time, but when one pushes back, the other person does not see what they did wrong. They thought they helped and contributed and get agitated when you close it down.

But it’s way worse than that. I see people develop parasocial relationships with their AIs, get heavily addicted to it, and create communities where people reinforce highly unhealthy behavior. How did we get here and what does it do to us?

Two things are both true to me right now: AI agents are amazing and a huge productivity boost. They are also massive slop machines if you turn off your brain and let go completely.
