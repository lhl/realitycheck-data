Gas Town is a new take on the IDE for 2026. Gas Town helps you with the tedium of running lots of Claude Code instances. Stuff gets lost, it’s hard to track who’s doing what, etc. Gas Town helps with all that yak shaving, and lets you focus on what your Claude Codes are working on.

(...)

First of all, the code base is under 3 weeks old. (...) I’m going to characterize Gas Town as “You probably don’t want to use it yet.” It needs some Lysol. It’s also 100% vibe coded. I’ve never seen the code, and I never care to, which might give you pause.

(...)

Stage 6: CLI, multi-agent, YOLO. You regularly use 3 to 5 parallel instances. You are very fast.

Stage 7: 10+ agents, hand-managed. You are starting to push the limits of hand-management.

Stage 8: Building your own orchestrator. You are on the frontier, automating your workflow.
