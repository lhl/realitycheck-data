Disclosure: I receive creator royalties/trading fees associated with $GAS trading on the BAGS platform, and I may benefit financially from that activity. I did not create $GAS and I have no ownership or control over the token or its smart contract (including no ability to change token terms). $GAS is not equity and does not give you any ownership interest in Gas Town or my work.

(...)

BAGS is a trading market targeted at predicting and fostering creators: individuals or maybe small teams who are out there creating amazing things.

(...)

As we move into 2026 with tools like Gas Town, individual creators will be able to produce things that rival the output of big companies. One creator can make a product using Gas Town that would have taken a whole company before. Creators are a force that is quickly beginning to matter at a global economic scale.

(...)

Millions of independent creators will appear when everyone can vibe code, which is roughly 2 frontier-model upgrades from now. Call it summertime. We’re going to need mechanisms to sort through all the noise to find the genuine hits.
