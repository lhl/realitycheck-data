It’s been 18 months, and we now know the answer. (...) Programmers will matter because everyone will be a programmer.

This transformation is already underway, with most roles at most companies writing some kind of code to accelerate their own department’s productivity, no longer blocked on engineers or third-party software. This trend will accelerate until we are in a world where everyone is building software, inside companies and out. Everyone will be a vibe coder.

(...)

Companies will need to rely on the three S’s to help AI work on monoliths: Signposting, Search Engines, and Senior Engineers. The three S’s will become increasingly important even for small companies as AI starts cranking out 10x-100x as much code.

I’ve got reports rolling in of companies concluding that not only should they not be writing code by hand, they should not be reviewing it manually either. The AI does everything, shepherded by humans.
