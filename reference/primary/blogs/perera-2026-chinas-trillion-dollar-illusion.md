## Key Excerpts (captured from the post)

> The four trillion dollars in China-exposed global assets currently held by sovereign wealth funds, pension systems, and institutional allocators rests on a single assumption that the data no longer supports. The assumption is this: that China’s record $1.189 trillion trade surplus for 2025, the largest in recorded history and the first to exceed one trillion dollars, represents manufacturing strength and export competitiveness that will sustain the economy through its property transition.
>
> The assumption is wrong.
>
> Not because exports are weak. They are genuinely strong. But because the surplus itself is the mathematical signature of demand destruction, not export dominance, and no economy in recorded history has ever sustained five percent real growth through ten consecutive quarters of deflation.

> The thesis is precise and falsifiable. China Vanke … faces RMB 9.4 billion in bond maturities over the next six months, with critical deadlines on January 22, January 27, and February 10, 2026. Bondholders have already rejected a one-year extension by 78.3 percent. The Shenzhen Metro Corporation … has publicly stated that its support has “surpassed its risk comfort zone” and that it “cannot provide unlimited guarantees.”

> Begin with the arithmetic, verified against GACC data released January 14, 2026. China’s 2025 exports totaled $3.77 trillion, growing 5.5 percent year-over-year … December alone posted a $114 billion surplus … with exports rising 6.6 percent and imports rising 5.7 percent …

> Consumer price inflation for the full year was exactly zero. Retail sales grew only 1.3 percent in November, the weakest pace since the pandemic reopening failed to ignite the expected consumption boom.

> China Vanke reported a loss of RMB 49.5 billion for 2024 … Through the first three quarters of 2025, Vanke accumulated an additional RMB 28 billion in losses … On December 23, 2025, S&P Global downgraded Vanke to “Selective Default,” … Fitch concurrently issued a “Restricted Default” rating.
