Beads Best Practices

Beads sits in an utterly unique space. Everyone is focused on making planning tools, and Beads is an execution tool. It’s like putting your coding agent on waxed skis.

(...)

Beads is now far, far more stable, nearly 6 weeks into its journey. (...) It is 100% vibe coded, currently at 130k lines of Go code total, roughly half tests. And tens of thousands of people are using it in their daily workflows. (...) And people are wiring it into larger orchestrators left and right.

(...)

Beads doesn’t have a UI (...) and Beads also doesn’t have a planning system. That’s not what it’s for. But it integrates well with any old planning system — just make your plan, then tell the agent to file Beads epics and issues for the work.

(...)

He said that Beads gives the agents shared memory, and MCP Agent Mail gives them messaging… and that’s all they need. (...) You just give them a task and tell them to go sort it out amongst themselves. There’s no ego, so they quickly decide on a leader and just split things up.

(...)

I am testing it out now (...) so I can easily switch between 30+ agent workers (...) And Mail will give them swarm capabilities. This is going to 3x–5x my productivity, I’m certain.
