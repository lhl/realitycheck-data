    bias_notes: AI-safety-adjacent forecasting project arguing for a plausible, fast
      timeline to transformative/superhuman AI. Uses a vivid narrative (“scenario”)
      plus quantitative-ish forecast pages; this can improve concreteness but also
      risks “story overfitting” and anchoring. Likely motivated to raise urgency (governance
      + security + alignment), which may bias toward faster and more catastrophic
      trajectories and underweight “muddling through” equilibria.

    accessed: '2026-02-06'
    reliability: 0.6
    bias_notes: First-party Anthropic product announcement (marketing + competitive
      incentives). Many capability claims are benchmark-based but can be harness-sensitive
      (tools, agent scaffold, sampling, and resource limits). Safety claims rely on
      Anthropic’s internal evaluations and system card framing; independent replication
      is limited.

    reliability: 0.65
    bias_notes: First-party system card describing Anthropic’s own evaluations, release
      decision process, and Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) determinations for Claude
      Opus 4.6. Provides substantially more methodological detail than a marketing
      post, and includes some external testing, but results (especially alignment
      and dangerous-capability evaluations) are still largely internal and not fully
      reproducible. Incentives may bias toward justifying deployment decisions and
      presenting comparative safety results favorably.

    url: https://www.anthropic.com/constitution
    accessed: '2026-01-23'
    reliability: 0.7
    bias_notes: First-party corporate values/behavior specification for Anthropic’s
      Claude models. Aspirational and normative; includes internal-process claims
      (training, oversight) that are hard to independently verify. Likely to emphasize
      safety/virtue framing and downplay misalignment risk, competitive pressures,
      and the costs of false refusals.

    reliability: 0.7
    bias_notes: Straight reporting plus expert quotes; limited primary evidence because
      PRC elite politics is intentionally opaque. Treat causal claims about motives

    year: 2026
    url: reference/primary/arclight-2026-aos.pdf
    accessed: '2026-02-01'
    reliability: 0.3
    bias_notes: Internal operating philosophy describing an institution design pattern
      (“AOS”) intended to produce durable “human coherence” (“arclight”). The document
      is rhetorically forceful and constraint-oriented, but offers little empirical
      grounding; many central constructs are non-operational (“phase change,” “quantum
      selectivity”) and the “must remain hidden” doctrine raises ethical concerns
      around informed consent and cult-dynamics risk.

    bias_notes: Strategy memo for a proposed AI “mentor” product. Strong on crisp
      positioning (anti-sycophancy; “graduation” metric) and on articulating a desired
      incentive alignment; weak on empirical grounding (market sizing, clinical/behavioral
      efficacy, safety/ethics) and uses rhetorically confident “laws” and pseudo-mathematical
