- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### LABOR-2026-002

> Full automation of human labor by 2035-2045

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: teortaxes-2026-thread
- **Target Date**: 2035-2045
- **Falsification**: >20% of economic output still requires human labor in 2045; clear new task creation outpacing automation
- **Verification**: <5% of economic output requires human labor; most industries fully automated
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### ECON-2026-003

> Post-labor → permanent underclass is 'default' outcome

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: teortaxes-2026-thread
- **Target Date**: Post-automation (conditional on LABOR-2026-002)
- **Falsification**: Post-labor transition occurs with broad-based prosperity; effective redistribution mechanisms emerge naturally
- **Verification**: Significant labor displacement + wealth concentration + no effective redistribution = permanent underclass formation
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### TRANS-2026-003

> The current generative-AI investment boom is a bubble that will burst, leading to widespread company failures and datacenter shutdowns/sell-offs; aftermath leaves salvage plus long cleanup

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: doctorow-2026-reverse-centaur
- **Target Date**: ~2030 (operationalization; source does not specify)
- **Falsification**: By 2030, the sector remains broadly capital-sustained/profitable with limited failure/shuttering; no clear deflation/shakeout occurs
- **Verification**: Wave of failures/fire-sale acquisitions; major datacenter buildouts halted or sold off at steep discounts; credible reporting frames it as a bust vs normal consolidation
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-19

#### RESOURCE-2025-001

> By 2040 at the latest, coal, gas, and oil land rights will be stranded assets that cannot be monetized.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: stross-2025-the-pivot-1
- **Target Date**: 2040-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2040-12-31, coal/gas/oil extraction rights remain broadly monetizable without major impairments/write-downs or binding legal restrictions.
- **Verification**: By 2040-12-31, a large fraction of fossil extraction rights/reserves are impaired/written down or legally unburnable, and are treated as stranded/near-zero in markets.
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### TECH-2025-002

> The hyperscale AI data center boom resembles a bubble; to the extent LLMs are useful, deployment will shift toward pre-trained models running on local hardware.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: stross-2025-the-pivot-1
- **Target Date**: 2030-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2030-12-31, most LLM inference remains centralized in hyperscale data centers and hyperscale AI capex continues to rise with strong realized returns; local inference remains niche.
- **Verification**: By 2030-12-31, a substantial share of LLM inference runs on local/edge hardware (consumer or enterprise) and hyperscale AI capex growth slows materially relative to 2024–2027 expectations, consistent with a boom-bust pattern.

#### TRANS-2025-007

> The forecast boom in small modular nuclear reactors will fizzle as cheap distributed solar PV plus battery storage scales.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: stross-2025-the-pivot-1
- **Target Date**: 2035-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2035-12-31, SMR deployments reach large-scale, cost-competitive rollout with multiple countries building fleets and costs comparable to competing firm low-carbon generation.
- **Verification**: By 2035-12-31, SMR deployments remain limited and non-competitive (widespread cancellations/delays and high costs) while PV+storage dominates new low-carbon capacity additions.
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### TECH-2025-007

> In the future, smartphones will not rely on conventional operating systems and discrete “apps”; instead, an AI will directly generate the pixels and sounds it predicts the user most wants to receive.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: jre-2404-elon-musk-2025-ai-woke-mind-virus
- **Target Date**: 2030-2035
- **Falsification**: By 2035, mainstream smartphones remain primarily OS+app-centric, with generative/agentic UIs confined to assistants or specific apps.
- **Verification**: By 2035, a mainstream mobile platform is primarily agentic/generative (pixels+sound generated per-user), and the discrete app/OS paradigm is no longer the dominant user interface model.
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### TECH-2026-014

> The next phase of AI products will be agents and workflow automation that run continuously, carry context over time, and take action across tools, becoming an operating layer for knowledge work.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: openai-value-intelligence
- **Target Date**: 2030-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2030, 'agents' remain niche demos or tightly constrained automations with limited adoption; app-centric workflows remain dominant and continuous autonomous operation is rare due to security/trust/governance constraints.
- **Verification**: By 2030, broadly-used agentic products run persistent workflows (multi-step tool use with authorization, long-lived context) for a substantial share of knowledge-work tasks (consumer and/or enterprise).
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-22

#### ECON-2026-018

> As AI moves into domains like scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models (licensing, IP-based agreements, and outcome-based pricing) will emerge to share in the value created.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: openai-value-intelligence
- **Target Date**: 2030-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2030, pricing remains dominated by subscriptions and usage-based billing, with licensing/IP/outcome-based models rare or economically marginal.
- **Verification**: By 2030, AI deployments in high-value domains (science/drug discovery/energy/finance) commonly use licensing, IP-based agreements, or outcome-based pricing, accounting for a meaningful share of vendor revenue (beyond standard subscriptions/usage billing).
