## Active Predictions

### On Track ([P→])

#### ECON-2026-010

> 'Creator explosion' forecast: millions of independent creators appear once 'everyone can vibe code' (claimed as a near-term function of ~2 frontier-model upgrades), forcing new discovery/market institutions

- **Source**: yegge-2026-bags-creator-economy
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### LABOR-2026-004

- **Source**: hotz-2026-three-minutes
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### TRANS-2026-004

> Near-term industry transition: small, fast shops dramatically outperform large companies for ~1+ year as coordination regimes lag behind agentic throughput

#### GOV-2026-026

> Canada is doubling its defence spending by the end of this decade (by ~2030)

- **Status**: [P→]
- **Source**: carney-2026-davos-wef-speech
- **Target Date**: 2030-12-31
- **Falsification**: Defense spending does not reach doubling target by 2030; Political change reverses commitment; Fiscal constraints prevent fulfillment
- **Verification**: Canadian defense budget doubles in real terms or as % of GDP by end of 2030
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### GOV-2026-027

> The post-WWII rules-based international order is not returning to its previous form

- **Status**: [P→]
- **Source**: carney-2026-davos-wef-speech
- **Falsification**: US policy reversal restores hegemonic stability; New international consensus emerges; Institutions adapt and regain effectiveness
- **Verification**: Rules-based order institutions continue decline in effectiveness and compliance over next decade
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

### Uncertain ([P?])

#### TECH-2026-002

> Largest training runs could exceed $1B by ~2027

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: epoch-2024-training-costs
- **Target Date**: ~2027
- **Falsification**: No training run exceeds $500M by end of 2027; trend clearly decelerating
- **Verification**: Credible reports of $1B+ training runs by major labs
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### LABOR-2026-002

> Full automation of human labor by 2035-2045

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: teortaxes-2026-thread
- **Target Date**: 2035-2045
- **Falsification**: >20% of economic output still requires human labor in 2045; clear new task creation outpacing automation
- **Verification**: <5% of economic output requires human labor; most industries fully automated
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### ECON-2026-003

> Post-labor → permanent underclass is 'default' outcome

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: teortaxes-2026-thread
- **Target Date**: Post-automation (conditional on LABOR-2026-002)
- **Falsification**: Post-labor transition occurs with broad-based prosperity; effective redistribution mechanisms emerge naturally
- **Verification**: Significant labor displacement + wealth concentration + no effective redistribution = permanent underclass formation
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### TRANS-2026-003

> The current generative-AI investment boom is a bubble that will burst, leading to widespread company failures and datacenter shutdowns/sell-offs; aftermath leaves salvage plus long cleanup

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: doctorow-2026-reverse-centaur
- **Target Date**: ~2030 (operationalization; source does not specify)
- **Falsification**: By 2030, the sector remains broadly capital-sustained/profitable with limited failure/shuttering; no clear deflation/shakeout occurs
- **Verification**: Wave of failures/fire-sale acquisitions; major datacenter buildouts halted or sold off at steep discounts; credible reporting frames it as a bust vs normal consolidation
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-19

#### RESOURCE-2025-001

> By 2040 at the latest, coal, gas, and oil land rights will be stranded assets that cannot be monetized.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: stross-2025-the-pivot-1
- **Target Date**: 2040-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2040-12-31, coal/gas/oil extraction rights remain broadly monetizable without major impairments/write-downs or binding legal restrictions.
- **Verification**: By 2040-12-31, a large fraction of fossil extraction rights/reserves are impaired/written down or legally unburnable, and are treated as stranded/near-zero in markets.
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### TECH-2025-002

> The hyperscale AI data center boom resembles a bubble; to the extent LLMs are useful, deployment will shift toward pre-trained models running on local hardware.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: stross-2025-the-pivot-1
- **Target Date**: 2030-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2030-12-31, most LLM inference remains centralized in hyperscale data centers and hyperscale AI capex continues to rise with strong realized returns; local inference remains niche.
- **Verification**: By 2030-12-31, a substantial share of LLM inference runs on local/edge hardware (consumer or enterprise) and hyperscale AI capex growth slows materially relative to 2024–2027 expectations, consistent with a boom-bust pattern.
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### TRANS-2025-007

> The forecast boom in small modular nuclear reactors will fizzle as cheap distributed solar PV plus battery storage scales.

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: stross-2025-the-pivot-1
- **Target Date**: 2035-12-31
- **Falsification**: By 2035-12-31, SMR deployments reach large-scale, cost-competitive rollout with multiple countries building fleets and costs comparable to competing firm low-carbon generation.
- **Verification**: By 2035-12-31, SMR deployments remain limited and non-competitive (widespread cancellations/delays and high costs) while PV+storage dominates new low-carbon capacity additions.
