## Active Predictions

### On Track ([P→])

#### ECON-2026-010

> 'Creator explosion' forecast: millions of independent creators appear once 'everyone can vibe code' (claimed as a near-term function of ~2 frontier-model upgrades), forcing new discovery/market institutions

- **Status**: [P→]
- **Source**: yegge-2026-bags-creator-economy
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-21

#### LABOR-2026-004

> Full human labor automation occurs within at most a single generation (possibly within a few years)

- **Status**: [P→]

#### TRANS-2026-004

> Near-term industry transition: small, fast shops dramatically outperform large companies for ~1+ year as coordination regimes lag behind agentic throughput

### Uncertain ([P?])

#### TECH-2026-002

> Largest training runs could exceed $1B by ~2027

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: epoch-2024-training-costs
- **Target Date**: ~2027
- **Falsification**: No training run exceeds $500M by end of 2027; trend clearly decelerating
- **Verification**: Credible reports of $1B+ training runs by major labs
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### LABOR-2026-002

> Full automation of human labor by 2035-2045

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: teortaxes-2026-thread
- **Target Date**: 2035-2045
- **Falsification**: >20% of economic output still requires human labor in 2045; clear new task creation outpacing automation
- **Verification**: <5% of economic output requires human labor; most industries fully automated
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### ECON-2026-003

> Post-labor → permanent underclass is 'default' outcome

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: teortaxes-2026-thread
- **Target Date**: Post-automation (conditional on LABOR-2026-002)
- **Falsification**: Post-labor transition occurs with broad-based prosperity; effective redistribution mechanisms emerge naturally
- **Verification**: Significant labor displacement + wealth concentration + no effective redistribution = permanent underclass formation
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-18

#### TRANS-2026-003

> The current generative-AI investment boom is a bubble that will burst, leading to widespread company failures and datacenter shutdowns/sell-offs; aftermath leaves salvage plus long cleanup

- **Status**: [P?]
- **Source**: doctorow-2026-reverse-centaur
- **Target Date**: ~2030 (operationalization; source does not specify)
- **Falsification**: By 2030, the sector remains broadly capital-sustained/profitable with limited failure/shuttering; no clear deflation/shakeout occurs
- **Verification**: Wave of failures/fire-sale acquisitions; major datacenter buildouts halted or sold off at steep discounts; credible reporting frames it as a bust vs normal consolidation
- **Last Evaluated**: 2026-01-19
