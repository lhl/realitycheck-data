## Summary Status

| Scenario | Current Assessment | Trend | Confidence |
|----------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| A: Pluralistic Abundance | Possible | → | 0.30 |
| B: Social Dividend State | Possible | → | 0.25 |
| C: Chaotic Multipolarity | Possible | → | 0.25 |
| D: Neofeudal/Security State | Possible | → | 0.20 |

**Legend**: ↑ increasing likelihood | ↓ decreasing likelihood | → stable/unclear

**Overall Assessment**: Too early to call. Evidence is mixed across both axes (bottleneck control and governance mode). Monitor quarterly.

## V1 Indicators: Bottleneck Control

Tracking whether infrastructure is diffusing or concentrating.

### Capability Indicators

| Indicator | Current State | Trend | Signal | Last Checked |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Open vs closed model gap | ~6 months | → | Diffuse | 2026-01-19 |
| Frontier model cost | $100M+ training runs | ↑ | Concentrated | 2026-01-19 |
| Open model reasoning capability | DeepSeek-R1 competitive | ↑ | Diffuse | 2026-01-19 |
| Agentic capability parity | Open models lagging | → | Contested | 2026-01-19 |

**Net Assessment**: Mixed. Model weights are diffusing; training capability is concentrating.

### Infrastructure Indicators

| Indicator | Current State | Trend | Signal | Last Checked |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Datacenter concentration | Hyperscaler dominant | ↑ | Concentrated | 2026-01-19 |
| Power contract monopolization | Vertical integration starting | ↑ | Concentrated | 2026-01-19 |
| Chip manufacturing geography | Taiwan/US dominant | → | Concentrated | 2026-01-19 |
| Inference cost trends | Falling but GPU-constrained | → | Mixed | 2026-01-19 |
| Edge inference capability | Improving slowly | → | Diffuse (weak) | 2026-01-19 |

**Net Assessment**: Infrastructure is concentrating. Hyperscaler buildout and vertical integration are real trends. Counter-forces (distributed energy, commodity compute) are present but weaker.

### Resource Indicators

| Indicator | Current State | Trend | Signal | Last Checked |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Datacenter electricity demand | 460 TWh (2024), 1000+ TWh projected 2030 | ↑ | Concentrated | 2026-01-19 |
| Hyperscaler raw material deals | Rio Tinto-Amazon copper contract | ↑ | Concentrated | 2026-01-19 |
| Chip export controls | Tightening (US-China) | ↑ | Concentrated | 2026-01-19 |
| Distributed energy deployment | Growing but slower than datacenter demand | → | Mixed | 2026-01-19 |

**Net Assessment**: Resource indicators favor concentration. Energy and material chokepoints are real.

## V2 Indicators: Governance Mode

Tracking whether governance is trending cooperative or coercive.

### Institutional Indicators

| Indicator | Current State | Trend | Signal | Last Checked |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| US democratic quality | Contested; institutional stress | ↓ | Coercive | 2026-01-19 |
| EU AI governance | AI Act implementation | → | Cooperative | 2026-01-19 |
| Japan AI policy | Inclusive approach, open model interest | → | Cooperative | 2026-01-19 |
| Global antitrust enforcement | Mixed; some action | → | Mixed | 2026-01-19 |

**Net Assessment**: Regional divergence. US trending coercive; EU/Japan more cooperative. Multipolarity thesis (GOV-2026-006) supported.

### Transfer/Redistribution Indicators

| Indicator | Current State | Trend | Signal | Last Checked |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| UBI pilot programs | Several active, no major national | → | Mixed | 2026-01-19 |
| Social safety net trends (US) | Contested; SNAP/Medicaid pressure | ↓ | Coercive | 2026-01-19 |
| Social safety net trends (EU) | Generally stable | → | Cooperative | 2026-01-19 |
| AI dividend/taxation proposals | Discussed; not implemented | → | Mixed | 2026-01-19 |

**Net Assessment**: No clear breakout toward either robust redistribution or total retrenchment. Status quo persisting.

### Legitimacy Indicators

| Indicator | Current State | Trend | Signal | Last Checked |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Elite rhetoric on population | Mixed | → | Monitor | 2026-01-19 |
| Surveillance deployment | Expanding in most jurisdictions | ↑ | Coercive | 2026-01-19 |
| Rights/civil liberties trends | Under pressure | ↓ | Coercive | 2026-01-19 |
| Public trust in institutions | Low/declining in many places | ↓ | Coercive | 2026-01-19 |

**Net Assessment**: Legitimacy indicators are concerning. Coercive signals outweigh cooperative ones.

## Confidence Calibration

How confident are we in these assessments?

| Category | Confidence | Why |

| Capability trends | 0.70 | Observable, verifiable |
| Infrastructure trends | 0.65 | Data available but incomplete |
| Governance trends | 0.50 | Contested, rapidly changing |
| Scenario probabilities | 0.40 | High uncertainty, multiple paths |

## Next Update

**Scheduled**: 2026-Q2 (April 2026)

**Watch for**:
- [ ] Major frontier model releases and open model response
- [ ] Datacenter/energy infrastructure announcements
- [ ] Policy developments (US, EU, Japan)
- [ ] Labor market automation signals

## Methodology Notes

### Data Sources
- AI capability: Model releases, benchmarks, user experience
- Infrastructure: Company announcements, industry reports, IEA data
- Governance: Policy announcements, democratic indices, rights organizations

### Limitations
- Most indicators are qualitative assessments, not quantitative metrics
- Regional variation is high; global assessments are necessarily simplified
- Scenario probabilities are rough estimates, not precise forecasts
- Dashboard reflects analyst judgment, subject to bias

### Updating Protocol
1. Review each indicator category
2. Note significant changes since last update
3. Assess trend direction
4. Update scenario probability assessments
5. Document reasoning in update log
