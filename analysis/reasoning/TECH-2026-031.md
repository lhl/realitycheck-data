# Reasoning: TECH-2026-031

> **Claim**: JP-TL-Bench evaluates a candidate model via reference-free, pairwise LLM comparisons against a fixed, versioned 20-model anchor set, and aggregates outcomes with a Bradley–Terry model into win-rate plus a 0–10 LT score.
> **Credence**: 0.90 (E3)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-031 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E3 and credence 0.90. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lin-2026-jp-tl-bench-paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00223)). Primary uncertainty is robustness/selection effects (expert judgment, preprint status, or limited replication); would strengthen with additional empirical corroboration. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The published code corresponds to the protocol described in the paper.
