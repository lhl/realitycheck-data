## Reasoning Chain

Anthropic’s system card provides a specific Terminal-Bench 2.0 score and details about harness and resources, so it is credible as a reported internal reproduction. But terminal-agent benchmarks are sensitive to agent scaffold, tools, and resource budgets; public leaderboard values differ under other agents, so credence in this number as a general ranking signal is moderate.
