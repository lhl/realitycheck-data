## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for SOC-2026-004 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.95. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., rawstory-2026-trump-voters-suicide-pact (https://www.rawstory.com/these-trump-voters-formed-a-pact-and-republicans-are-panicking-ex-gop-operative/)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The ERS “Farming” industry-dependence label corresponds to Wilson’s “farming-dependent counties” phrasing.
