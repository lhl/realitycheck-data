# Reasoning: RISK-2026-919

> **Claim**: OpenAI states this is the first GPT-5.*-Codex launch treated as “High capability” in the Cybersecurity domain under its Preparedness Framework and that it activated the associated cyber safeguards, taking a precautionary approach because it cannot rule out that the model meets the High threshold.
> **Credence**: 0.85 (E4)
> **Domain**: RISK

## Reasoning Chain

OpenAI’s system card explicitly states GPT-5.3-Codex is the first Codex launch treated as High capability in the cybersecurity domain and that associated safeguards are activated, while also noting the classification is precautionary because they cannot rule out threshold-level capability. This is highly credible as a statement of OpenAI’s governance posture; validating the practical enforcement of the safeguards requires additional operational evidence.
