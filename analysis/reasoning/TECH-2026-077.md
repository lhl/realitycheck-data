## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-077 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E4 and credence 0.85. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., liquidai-2025-lfm2-350m-enjp-mt (https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2-350M-ENJP-MT)). Primary uncertainty is reporting/summary error and selection bias; would strengthen with primary documents, datasets, or multiple independent outlets. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- Bidirectionality implies the model was trained/evaluated for both directions.
