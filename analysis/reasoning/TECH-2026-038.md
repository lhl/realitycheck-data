# Reasoning: TECH-2026-038

> **Claim**: Translation direction (EN→JA vs JA→EN) can differ substantially for many models, so a single language-pair score can hide important failures.
> **Credence**: 0.80 (E3)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-038 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E3 and credence 0.80. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lin-2026-jp-tl-bench-paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00223)). Primary uncertainty is robustness/selection effects (expert judgment, preprint status, or limited replication); would strengthen with additional empirical corroboration. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The benchmark includes sufficient items in each direction to estimate slice scores.
