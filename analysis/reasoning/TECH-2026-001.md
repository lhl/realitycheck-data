## Reasoning Chain

This trail supersedes older/stale test trails by recording the current assignment for TECH-2026-001: credence 0.80, evidence level E2. Supporting evidence is linked (EVLINK-2026-089) to the primary source used at extraction time. Remaining uncertainty is mainly about definition/measurement (what counts as “frontier”, which models are included, and how costs are estimated); cross-checking with multiple independent cost estimates would further strengthen confidence.

## Assumptions

- The linked source supports the claim as summarized.
