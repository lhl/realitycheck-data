## Reasoning Chain

The document explicitly names multiple external organizations involved in testing (AISI, Andon Labs) and includes a dedicated section on Apollo Research. This supports high credence that Anthropic engaged these groups in some testing capacity; the remaining uncertainty is about depth, representativeness, and whether results materially constrain risk.
