# Reasoning: TECH-2026-096

> **Claim**: Output tokens are materially more expensive than input tokens because decode is sequential and largely memory-bandwidth-bound, while prefill is parallelizable and compute-efficient; for typical frontier models, decode throughput per GPU is often 10–50× lower than prefill throughput.
> **Credence**: 0.75 (E3)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-096 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E3 and credence 0.75. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lhl-2026-frontier-llm-token-unit-economics (https://github.com/lhl/frontier-llm-token-unit-economics)). Primary uncertainty is robustness/selection effects (expert judgment, preprint status, or limited replication); would strengthen with additional empirical corroboration. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The workload is throughput-limited by memory bandwidth during decode at scale.
