# Reasoning: TECH-2026-083

> **Claim**: The technical report’s extracted per-language WMT24++ MetricX table lists language pairs as en→* and does not provide a corresponding ja→en table, limiting claims about Japanese→English regressions from this source alone.

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-083 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.80. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., google-2026-translategemma-tech-report (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09012)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The extracted tables reflect the report’s presented per-language WMT24++ evaluation.
