## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-021 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.80. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., vectifyai-2025-pageindex (https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions
