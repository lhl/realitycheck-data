## Reasoning Chain

OpenAI’s system card states Codex cloud supports per-project network access controls (allowlist/denylist) and explains the associated risks (prompt injection, credential leakage, licensing). This supports high credence that such controls are intended and documented, with remaining uncertainty about completeness and enforcement in all real-world configurations.
