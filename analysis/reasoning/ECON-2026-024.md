# Reasoning: ECON-2026-024

> **Claim**: For a subscription plan with monthly revenue R and blended variable cost c ($/MTok), break-even token volume is approximately (R / c) million tokens per month, so modest increases in blended cost can sharply reduce the break-even token budget.
> **Credence**: 0.90 (E2)
> **Domain**: ECON

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for ECON-2026-024 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.90. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lhl-2026-frontier-llm-token-unit-economics (https://github.com/lhl/frontier-llm-token-unit-economics)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- Variable cost is approximately linear in tokens under the blended cost approximation.
