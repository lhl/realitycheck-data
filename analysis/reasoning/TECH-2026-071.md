# Reasoning: TECH-2026-071

> **Claim**: In the llm-jp-eval MT setup documented by the repo, ALT uses 4-shot exemplars while WikiCorpus is zero-shot, which can introduce few-shot asymmetry when comparing model performance across datasets.
> **Credence**: 0.85 (E2)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-071 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.85. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lhl-2025-liquid-ai-hackathon-tokyo (https://github.com/lhl/liquid-ai-hackathon-tokyo)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- Few-shot examples materially affect model outputs for at least some models.
