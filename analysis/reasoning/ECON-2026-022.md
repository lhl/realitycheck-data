# Reasoning: ECON-2026-022

> **Claim**: In the OpenAI case study, total estimated API-equivalent cost divided by total tokens implies an effective cost around $0.31 per million tokens, and the observed cost depends on the actual model mix rather than a single list-rate model.
> **Credence**: 0.85 (E2)
> **Domain**: ECON

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for ECON-2026-022 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.85. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lhl-2026-frontier-llm-token-unit-economics (https://github.com/lhl/frontier-llm-token-unit-economics)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The reported estimated cost reflects pricing applied consistently across the logged model mix.
