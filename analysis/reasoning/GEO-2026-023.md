## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for GEO-2026-023 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E4 and credence 0.85. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., jamestown-2025-pla-aircraft-incursions-taiwan-airspace-2024 (https://jamestown.org/military-implications-of-pla-aircraft-incursions-in-taiwans-airspace-2024/)). Primary uncertainty is reporting/summary error and selection bias; would strengthen with primary documents, datasets, or multiple independent outlets. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The “detected aircraft” denominator is defined consistently across years.
