> **Claim**: Anthropic states Claude Opus 4.6 was trained on a proprietary mix that includes publicly available internet data up to May 2025, non-public third-party data, data from data-labeling services and paid contractors, opted-in user data, and internally generated data, with filtering such as deduplication and classification.

## Evidence Summary

| Direction | Source | Location | Strength | Summary |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Supports | [anthropic-2026-claude-opus-4-6-system-card](../sources/anthropic-2026-claude-opus-4-6-system-card.md) | artifact=pdf; locator=Sec. 1.1.1 (Training data and process) | 0.8 | System card states Opus 4.6 training data sources ... |

## Reasoning Chain

Anthropic’s Opus 4.6 system card explicitly describes the training-data mix (including a May 2025 public-internet cutoff) as part of its model characteristics section. This is strong evidence that Anthropic is making this claim, but external verification of the actual training corpus and cutoff is limited; credence is therefore moderate rather than near-certain.
