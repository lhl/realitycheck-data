# Reasoning: INST-2026-912

> **Claim**: OpenAI states Codex agents operate in isolated sandboxes: cloud agents run in isolated containers with network access disabled by default; local Codex runs commands in OS-level sandboxes (macOS Seatbelt, Linux seccomp+landlock, Windows sandbox/WSL), restricting edits to the workspace by default, with optional user approval for unsandboxed execution.
> **Credence**: 0.80 (E4)
> **Domain**: INST

## Reasoning Chain

The system card explicitly describes Codex sandboxing for both cloud (isolated containers) and local execution (OS-level sandboxing primitives) and states network is disabled by default with workspace-restricted edits. This supports high credence for the claim as a description of OpenAI’s stated product defaults, though operational enforcement should be validated in practice across platforms.
