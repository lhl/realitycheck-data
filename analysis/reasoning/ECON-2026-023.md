# Reasoning: ECON-2026-023

> **Claim**: Under Anthropic prompt-caching pricing (5m write=1.25× base input, read=0.1×; 1h write=2×, read=0.1×), caching becomes cheaper than resending uncached input after about 1.28 total uses of a prefix (5m) or about 2.11 total uses (1h).
> **Credence**: 0.90 (E2)
> **Domain**: ECON

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for ECON-2026-023 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.90. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lhl-2026-frontier-llm-token-unit-economics (https://github.com/lhl/frontier-llm-token-unit-economics)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The multipliers apply as documented and the cache hit occurs after an initial write.
