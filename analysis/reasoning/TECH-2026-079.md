## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-079 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E3 and credence 0.90. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., google-2026-translategemma-tech-report (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09012)). Primary uncertainty is robustness/selection effects (expert judgment, preprint status, or limited replication); would strengthen with additional empirical corroboration. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The report accurately describes the released models’ training process.
