## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for GOV-2026-034 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.98. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions (https://x.com/BlueBadger2600/status/2015086695566451161)).

This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- “Alien” is interpreted as “noncitizen” under the INA definition.
