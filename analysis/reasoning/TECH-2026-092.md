## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-092 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.85. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lhl-2026-frontier-llm-token-unit-economics (https://github.com/lhl/frontier-llm-token-unit-economics)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- Provider documentation accurately describes the implementation at a conceptual level.
