## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for RESOURCE-2026-012 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E4 and credence 0.85. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., taipeitimes-2022-energy-supplies-sufficient-ministry (https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2022/08/04/2003782917)). Primary uncertainty is reporting/summary error and selection bias; would strengthen with primary documents, datasets, or multiple independent outlets. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The quoted “days of consumption” figure reflects a comparable, system-wide inventory measure.
