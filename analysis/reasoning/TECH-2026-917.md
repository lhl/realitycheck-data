# Reasoning: TECH-2026-917

> **Claim**: Anthropic states Claude Opus 4.6 retains “extended thinking mode” and adds “adaptive thinking” for API customers; the effort parameter has four settings (low/medium/high/max) that affect when extended thinking is used, enabling cost/speed/intelligence tradeoffs.
> **Credence**: 0.80 (E4)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

The system card provides a concrete description of extended thinking, adaptive thinking (API), and the four effort levels. This is directly checkable against Anthropic API/product behavior, so credence is relatively high, though availability and exact behavior can vary by platform/rollout and may change over time.
