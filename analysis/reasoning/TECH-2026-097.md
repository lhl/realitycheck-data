# Reasoning: TECH-2026-097

> **Claim**: KV-cache memory per sequence scales roughly as KV_bytes = 2 × layers × hidden_dim × bytes_per_param × context_length, so long-context usage for large models can require hundreds of GB per active session—often exceeding a single GPU’s VRAM—and therefore motivates TTLs, tiered cache storage, and KV quantization/paging.
> **Credence**: 0.85 (E2)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-097 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.85. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lhl-2026-frontier-llm-token-unit-economics (https://github.com/lhl/frontier-llm-token-unit-economics)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The formula’s simplifying assumptions (dense KV per layer per token) approximate deployed implementations.
