# Reasoning: TECH-2025-003

> **Claim**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related tuning can encode preferences/constraints that change a model’s outputs (including shifting outputs away from literal truthfulness) by rewarding or punishing responses during training.
> **Credence**: 0.75 (E3)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2025-003 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E3 and credence 0.75. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., jre-2404-elon-musk-2025-ai-woke-mind-virus (https://podscripts.co/podcasts/the-joe-rogan-experience/2404-elon-musk)). Primary uncertainty is robustness/selection effects (expert judgment, preprint status, or limited replication); would strengthen with additional empirical corroboration. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- Human feedback signals meaningfully influence model policy.
- Preference labels can be applied at scale during tuning.
