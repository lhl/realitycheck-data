## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-030 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.95. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., kamathhrishi-2025-stratalens-ai (https://github.com/kamathhrishi/stratalens-ai)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- Absence of an explicit license implies no clear permission to reuse beyond default copyright.
