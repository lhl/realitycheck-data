## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-087 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E3 and credence 0.75. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lin-2026-jp-tl-bench-paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00223)). Primary uncertainty is robustness/selection effects (expert judgment, preprint status, or limited replication); would strengthen with additional empirical corroboration. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- Many evaluation setups lack sufficient context to resolve pro-drop and register selection.
