## Evidence Summary

| Direction | Source | Location | Strength | Summary |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| Supports | [anthropic-2026-claude-opus-4-6-system-card](../sources/anthropic-2026-claude-opus-4-6-system-card.md) | artifact=pdf; locator=Sec. 2.4 (SWE-bench) | 0.8 | System card reports SWE-bench Verified and Multili... |

## Reasoning Chain

The system card clearly reports these SWE-bench scores and describes the trial-averaging setup, so it is highly credible as a statement of Anthropic’s reported result. However, SWE-bench results can be sensitive to harness/prompt/tooling and are not always trivially reproducible, so credence in the score as a broadly comparable metric is moderate.
