## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-015 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E2 and credence 0.90. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., islam-2023-financebench (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11944)). Primary uncertainty is whether the underlying official/peer-reviewed data were interpreted correctly and are comparable across contexts; independent replication would strengthen. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The public release corresponds to the dataset described in the paper.
