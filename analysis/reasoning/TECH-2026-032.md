# Reasoning: TECH-2026-032

> **Claim**: Anchoring pairwise comparisons to a frozen base set yields structurally stable scores under a fixed protocol (base set + judge + aggregation code) and reduces per-candidate evaluation cost to O(items×anchors) rather than O(N²) all-pairs comparisons.
> **Credence**: 0.90 (E3)
> **Domain**: TECH

## Reasoning Chain

This trail documents the current credence/evidence assignment for TECH-2026-032 as stored in the database. The claim is recorded with evidence level E3 and credence 0.90. Supporting evidence is linked via 1 evidence-link(s) (see list) and the source(s) listed in the claim record (e.g., lin-2026-jp-tl-bench-paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00223)). Primary uncertainty is robustness/selection effects (expert judgment, preprint status, or limited replication); would strengthen with additional empirical corroboration. This backfill does not constitute fresh verification; it makes the provenance explicit and reviewable.

## Assumptions

- The anchor set and anchor-anchor judgments remain fixed across evaluations.
- The judge model/decoding configuration is held constant when comparing scores over time.
