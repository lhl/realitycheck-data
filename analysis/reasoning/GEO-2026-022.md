## Reasoning Chain

Assigned 0.85 because the claim is a concrete numeric comparison attributed to Taiwan MND and reported by a specialist defense outlet. Main uncertainty: Janes notes reduced reporting detail in 2024; if the underlying counting definition changed materially, the year-over-year comparison could be distorted. A direct re-aggregation from primary MND releases would increase confidence.

## Assumptions

- Taiwan MND counting/reporting is comparable across 2023 and 2024
