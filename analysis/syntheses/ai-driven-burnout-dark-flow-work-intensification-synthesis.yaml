      Internal cross-source synthesis in realitycheck-data. Integrates a field-study taxonomy (HBR), controlled
      measurement (METR), survey+admin outcomes (NBER), and practitioner/anecdotal accounts (Willison, Yegge, HN
      comments, fast.ai, social threads), plus a repo-churn case study as an upper-tail feasibility baseline.
      Conclusions are credence-weighted and provisional pending additional measurement and replication in diverse
      workplaces.
