      Internal cross-source synthesis document in realitycheck-data (analysis/syntheses). Integrates vendor doctrine
      (StrongDM), practitioner essays (Shapiro/Willison/Schillace), and control-plane field reports (DoltHub/Gas Town)
      with existing repo analyses (Yegge/Appleton/Ronacher). Conclusions are credence-weighted and should be treated as
      provisional pending measurement and replication.
