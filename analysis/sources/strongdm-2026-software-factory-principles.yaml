      Concise “operating doctrine” for StrongDM’s software-factory concept; primarily prescriptive. Most claims
      are workflow axioms, not measurements. Useful for extracting the core loop and what they treat as “ground
      truth” (holdout scenarios).

      StrongDM defines a software factory as a closed loop of Seed → end-to-end validation harness → feedback,
      run until holdout scenarios pass (and keep passing), with tokens as the “fuel.”

    operationalization: >-
      Track whether organizations adopting this doctrine implement hidden holdout suites and measure whether
      those suites predict production incident rates and user satisfaction better than non-holdout tests.
    assumptions:
      - Holdout scenarios can be meaningfully defined and maintained over time.
    falsifiers:
      - Holdout scenarios do not correlate with improved production outcomes relative to baseline testing.

      StrongDM prescribes that a validation harness should be end-to-end and as close to the real environment
      as possible, including customers, integrations, and economics.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare teams that incorporate production-like integrations and economic constraints into pre-merge
      scenarios versus teams that do not; measure defect/incident rate, cycle time, and cost.
    assumptions:
      - Economic constraints can be represented with measurable signals.
    falsifiers:
      - Teams with “economics-in-the-harness” do not show better outcomes after controlling for confounders.

      StrongDM frames “frontier engineering” as converting obstacles into representations models can consume,
      using artifacts like traces, screen capture, transcripts, incident replays, adversarial use, simulation,
      surveys, interviews, and price-elasticity testing.

    source_ids: ["strongdm-2026-software-factory-principles"]
    operationalization: >-
      Run controlled experiments varying representation artifacts provided to agents and measure changes in
      task success rate, generalization to holdouts, and debugging time.
    assumptions:
      - Representation artifacts can be produced at reasonable cost.
    falsifiers:
      - Providing these artifacts yields no improvement or worsens performance due to noise/overfitting.
