      Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related tuning can
      encode preferences/constraints that change a model’s outputs (including
      shifting outputs away from literal truthfulness) by rewarding or punishing
      responses during training.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare base vs. instruction-tuned/RLHF-tuned models on controlled
      evaluation sets where truthfulness conflicts with policy preferences; show
      systematic output shifts correlated with preference rewards.
    assumptions:
      - Human feedback signals meaningfully influence model policy.
      - Preference labels can be applied at scale during tuning.
    falsifiers:
      - Controlled comparisons show no meaningful output differences attributable
        to feedback when preference labels are varied.

      Google Gemini’s image generation system produced historically inaccurate
      images for some prompts (e.g., “founding fathers of the United States”
      rendered as diverse women) and Google paused/adjusted the feature in

      Verify via archived outputs and credible reporting; confirm that Google
      publicly acknowledged the issue and paused/adjusted the image generation.
    assumptions:
      - Reports accurately represent observed outputs and Google’s response.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible archives show the behavior did not occur or the reported
        remediation did not happen.

      Reproduce the exact prompt and system conditions (model/version/date,

    assumptions:
      - The reported example reflects a real interaction with a mainstream model.
    falsifiers:
      - Archived transcripts or controlled re-runs show models do not output
        this ranking under comparable conditions.

      If an AI system is trained primarily on uncurated internet data without a
      strong truth-seeking objective, it will tend to reproduce prevalent online
      beliefs and biases found in its training data.

      Measure correlations between training-corpus bias metrics and model output
      bias metrics across variants with different filtering and truthfulness
      optimization.
    assumptions:
      - Later alignment steps do not fully eliminate training-data imprinting.
    falsifiers:
      - Models trained on measurably biased corpora do not reproduce the biases,
        or truth objectives do not reduce them.

      In the future, smartphones will not rely on conventional operating systems

      displaced by agentic, generative interfaces in consumer devices over
      5–10 years.
    assumptions:
      - UX can shift from app marketplaces to agentic generation.
      - Users accept high personalization/automation in core device workflows.
    falsifiers:
      - App-centric OS models remain dominant and generative interfaces remain
        limited to specific apps/assistants.

      Building an AI assistant that is consistently truth-seeking in practice
      (rather than regurgitating low-quality internet content) requires

      Compare development effort (data curation, evals, RLHF cost, red-teaming)
      required to achieve stable truthfulness benchmarks across model families.
    assumptions:
      - “Truthfulness” can be operationalized via standardized benchmarks and
        adversarial evaluation.
    falsifiers:
      - Naively trained models achieve comparable truthfulness without extensive
        added curation/alignment work.

      Define control in operational terms (capability dominance, goal retention,
      containment, corrigibility). Evaluate whether any proposed alignment and
      containment scheme could provide durable control over a superhuman system.
    assumptions:
      - Digital superintelligence achieves broad capability dominance.

      Test models under regimes that enforce known falsehoods and measure
      downstream coherence, calibration, and adversarial behavior relative to
      truth-optimized regimes.
    assumptions:
      - “Knows” can be proxied by internal consistency and calibration metrics.
      - Enforced falsehood constraints persist as models scale.
    falsifiers:
      - Enforcing falsehood constraints does not worsen coherence/stability, or
        interventions can isolate such constraints without side effects.

      In toy and medium-scale agent environments, show that optimizing narrowly

        such “separate team” intervention occurred.
