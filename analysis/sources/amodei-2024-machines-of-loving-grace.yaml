      CEO of a frontier lab writing an intentionally inspiring best-case vision; strong incentives to frame rapid
      progress as plausible and beneficial, and to foreground “manageable constraints” rather than failure modes.
      Many claims are conditional and inherently hard to verify ex ante.

      “Powerful AI” meeting the essay’s operational definition (broad superhuman competence, autonomy, tool use,
      and scalable instances) could arrive as early as 2026, though it could also take much longer.

    operationalization: >-
      Define a checklist threshold (autonomous multi-day task completion; reliable computer/internet control; broad
      superhuman performance across key fields; ability to run large numbers of fast instances) and assess whether
      any deployed system meets it by 2026-12-31.
    assumptions:
      - The essay’s definition is measurable with public or auditable indicators.
    falsifiers:
      - No system meeting the definition exists by 2026-12-31.

    text: >-
      The essay defines “powerful AI” as a scalable autonomous system with broad superhuman competence, access to
      human-like interfaces (including computer and internet control), and the ability to run millions of fast
      instances—summarizable as a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.”

      Verify the definition in the source text and map each property to measurable indicators (autonomy, tool use,
      replication, speedup).
    assumptions: []
    falsifiers:
      - The source does not include these definitional properties.

      Powerful AI could increase the rate of key biology and medicine discoveries by at least 10×, compressing
      roughly 50–100 years of biological progress into about 5–10 years (“compressed 21st century”).

    operationalization: >-
      Track (a) validated biomedical discoveries (e.g., new mechanisms, modalities), (b) translation metrics
      (clinical-trial cycle time; approval rates), and (c) population-level outcome improvements; compare
      decade-over-decade changes before vs after reaching the defined “powerful AI” threshold.
    assumptions:
      - Discovery and translation rates are measurable and comparable over time.
      - AI-driven insight meaningfully reduces the dominant constraints in biomedical progress.
    falsifiers:
      - No order-of-magnitude acceleration is observed in validated outcomes within ~10 years of the threshold.

      Even with a “country of geniuses in a datacenter,” real-world progress is constrained by complementary
      bottlenecks (experiment latency, hardware build times, data scarcity, and institutional/human constraints),
      so the correct pace model is “extremely fast but not instant.”

    operationalization: >-
      For multiple domains (biomedicine, hardware, governance), measure the share of project cycle time explained
      by non-cognitive latencies vs cognitive work; test whether added cognition reduces total cycle time beyond
      those latencies.
    assumptions:
      - Bottlenecks can be decomposed into cognitive vs non-cognitive components.
    falsifiers:
      - Observed transformations are either near-instant across domains or negligibly affected by added cognition.

    text: >-
      Within 5–10 years after powerful AI, a good fraction (on the order of 50%) of AI-driven health benefits could
      propagate to even the poorest countries, conditional on major coordinated effort in global health,
      philanthropy, and political advocacy.

      For a basket of high-impact AI-enabled interventions, measure coverage, cost, and realized morbidity/mortality
      impact in low-income countries vs high-income countries over a decade; compare to historical diffusion baselines.
    assumptions:
      - High-impact interventions exist and can be deployed in low-income contexts.
      - Political and logistical barriers are tractable with sufficient coordination.
    falsifiers:
      - Diffusion remains slow and highly unequal despite available interventions and investment.

    text: >-
      Democracies should pursue an “entente strategy” to prevent AI-enabled authoritarian dominance, including
      securing AI supply chains, scaling quickly, and blocking or delaying adversaries’ access to key resources like
      chips and semiconductor equipment, paired with benefit-sharing to expand a coalition.

    operationalization: >-
      Evaluate whether export controls and supply-chain security correlate with (a) democratic capability lead,
      (b) reduced authoritarian repression enabled by AI, and (c) lower crisis instability; compare against
      counterfactual regimes (cooperation-focused, open-diffusion).
    assumptions:
      - Capability lead can be measured with proxies (compute, models, deployment).
    falsifiers:
      - Denial strategies increase instability or fail to slow adversary capability accumulation.
