      Taiwan authorities assess that China’s espionage operations in Taiwan are rapidly advancing and pose a serious threat to
      Taiwan’s national security.

    operationalization: >-
      Collect Taiwan NSB/Defense Ministry/Control Yuan official assessments over time and assess whether threat metrics and
      described sophistication have increased.
    assumptions:
      - Public Taiwan assessments reflect real internal threat evaluations.
    falsifiers:
      - Official assessments show no trend toward “rapidly advancing” or severe threat.

      Verify against Taiwan prosecutor/NSB published case statistics and confirm definitional consistency across years.
    assumptions:
      - The “cases” definition is consistent (or can be normalized) across years.
    falsifiers:
      - Official datasets show materially different counts or inconsistent definitions.

      In Taiwan’s PRC-espionage prosecutions cited for 2024 and the first nine months of 2025, nearly two-thirds of those charged
      were active or retired military personnel.

      Verify the numerator/denominator against case-level public records and compute the military share.
    assumptions:
      - Classification of “military personnel” is consistent across cases.
    falsifiers:
      - Verified breakdown shows a materially different share.

      PRC agents increasingly target lower-ranking Taiwanese military members for recruitment using messaging apps and online loan
      offers, often for relatively small payments.

    evidence_level: "E4"

    source_ids: ["wsj-2026-chinese-spy-machine-taiwan-military"]
    operationalization: >-
      Build a dataset of publicly reported/prosecuted recruitment cases and code the rank of the target and recruitment channel;
      test for a time trend toward lower rank and online channels.
    assumptions:
      - Publicly prosecuted cases are representative of the broader recruitment strategy.
    falsifiers:
      - Case data shows stable or opposite trends (higher-rank focus; non-digital channels dominate).

      Taiwan officials fear that PRC agents already in place inside Taiwan would materially aid a PLA attack by providing
      intelligence, targeting data, or sabotage support.

    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.50
    source_ids: ["wsj-2026-chinese-spy-machine-taiwan-military"]
    operationalization: >-
      Assess the depth and capability of known infiltration networks and whether detected plots included actionable targeting
      or sabotage plans relevant to a contingency.
    assumptions:
      - Infiltration networks, if present, can translate into operational impact during conflict.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows infiltration is low-value and does not translate into operational impact in realistic scenarios.
