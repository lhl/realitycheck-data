      The Wall Street Journal reports that an internal high-level briefing alleged Gen. Zhang Youxia leaked “core technical data”
      on China’s nuclear weapons to the United States.

      Seek corroboration from additional independent outlets or authoritative disclosures; assess feasibility given Zhang’s access
      and communication constraints and specify what “core technical data” means.
    assumptions:
      - WSJ’s unnamed sources accurately described the content of the briefing.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible corrections or authoritative accounts indicate no nuclear-leak allegation existed.

      The Wall Street Journal reports that an internal briefing alleged Gen. Zhang Youxia accepted large bribes for official acts,
      including helping elevate Li Shangfu to senior positions.

    credence: 0.45
    source_ids: ["wsj-2026-top-general-nuclear-secrets"]
    operationalization: >-
      Look for corroborating reporting or PRC disclosures that connect Zhang to promotion/procurement bribery networks; track whether
      the official narrative later emphasizes bribery/procurement.
    assumptions:
      - WSJ’s unnamed sources accurately described the briefing allegations.
    falsifiers:
      - Later disclosures show charges are unrelated to bribery/promotion.

      The Wall Street Journal reports that evidence against Zhang Youxia was linked to the investigation of Gu Jun (former general
      manager of China National Nuclear Corp.) and an alleged security breach in China’s nuclear sector.

    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.50
    source_ids: ["wsj-2026-top-general-nuclear-secrets"]
    operationalization: >-
      Seek corroboration that Gu Jun’s case materially implicated Zhang; track whether other reporting confirms a nuclear-sector
      breach and the chain of evidence.
    assumptions:
      - WSJ’s sources accurately described the claimed evidentiary linkage.
    falsifiers:
      - Later reporting shows Gu Jun’s investigation is unrelated to Zhang.

      The Wall Street Journal reports Xi Jinping commissioned a task force to investigate Zhang Youxia’s tenure in Shenyang (2007–2012),
      that investigators stayed in local hotels rather than military bases, and that devices were seized from officers tied to Zhang and Liu.

    operationalization: >-
      Seek corroboration from additional outlets or subsequent disclosures; assess whether comparable task-force patterns are documented
      in past PLA anticorruption investigations.
    assumptions:
      - WSJ’s sources accurately described the task-force operational details.
    falsifiers:
      - Later credible reporting contradicts the existence or described behavior of the task force.

      The leadership vacuum created by the purge may lower the near-term probability of a Taiwan invasion-scale operation, as Xi Jinping
      pivots to a more calculated strategy that prioritizes negotiating with the U.S. leadership before escalating.

    source_ids: ["wsj-2026-top-general-nuclear-secrets"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track invasion indicators vs gray-zone coercion; examine U.S.–PRC diplomatic signaling and whether “deal-first” language or actions
      materially appear.
    assumptions:
      - Xi’s near-term Taiwan choices are constrained by leadership vacuum and U.S. negotiation dynamics.
    falsifiers:
      - No evidence of deal-first posture and invasion indicators increase despite the purge.

      A severe vacuum at the very top of the PLA’s command structure is likely to affect the PLA’s readiness for major, complex military
      operations in the short to medium term.

    domain: "RISK"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.50

    operationalization: >-
      Track training tempo, exercise complexity, appointment stability, and operational mishap rates in the months after the purge.
    assumptions:
      - Senior leadership stability is a binding constraint for complex joint operations.
    falsifiers:
      - Readiness indicators and operational performance show no degradation despite the vacuum.
