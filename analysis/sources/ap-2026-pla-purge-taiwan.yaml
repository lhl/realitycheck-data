      Straight reporting plus expert quotes; limited primary evidence because PRC elite politics is intentionally
      opaque. Treat causal claims about motives and Taiwan implications as analyst interpretation rather than
      directly evidenced facts.

      In late January 2026, China’s Ministry of National Defense announced it had opened a case for review
      and investigation into Gen. Zhang Youxia for suspected serious violations of party discipline and the law.

      Confirm via the MoD statement text and/or multiple independent wire reports; track whether PRC state
      media later issues formal removal/dismissal notices.
    assumptions:
      - AP accurately summarized the MoD announcement.
    falsifiers:
      - An authoritative PRC transcript or correction states no investigation was opened.

      The reported investigations of Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli, combined with earlier removals, leave the
      Central Military Commission’s uniformed leadership largely vacant, with Xi Jinping and Zhang Shengmin
      described as the only active named members.

      Compare outlet-by-outlet descriptions to an authoritative roster definition of the CMC (total members,
      uniformed members, and whether “under investigation” officials remain formally in post).
    assumptions:
      - Public reporting correctly reflects the practical (de facto) leadership vacuum.
    falsifiers:
      - Authoritative CMC member list shows multiple other active uniformed members in post.

      Since 2012, Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign has punished more than roughly 200,000 officials.

      Validate against official CCDI/National Supervisory Commission statistics and reputable longitudinal
      datasets on disciplinary actions by year.
    assumptions:
      - The reported figure refers to a consistent category of “punished officials” over time.
    falsifiers:
      - Official statistics show materially lower totals for comparable categories.

      Since 2012, at least 17 PLA generals have been removed from their military positions (as counted in an
      AP review of military statements and state media reports).

      Reproduce the count via an independently compiled roster of PLA generals and official removal notices,
      including definition choices (rank cutoff, “removed” vs “investigated”).
    assumptions:
      - AP’s review used a consistent and reasonable definition of “general removed.”
    falsifiers:
      - A reproduced roster-based count materially differs under comparable definitions.

      The purge of top PLA leaders reduces near-term risk of a Taiwan escalation (due to high-command disarray)
      but may increase long-term risk if it produces a more loyal, less corrupt leadership and improved capability.

      Track near-term indicators of invasion planning (mobilization, logistics, readiness exercises) versus
      gray-zone coercion; track medium-term leadership stabilization and capability improvements after replacements.
    assumptions:
      - Command disarray is materially binding for major joint operations.
      - Replacement leaders are (on average) more loyal and less corrupt.
    falsifiers:
      - No measurable short-term disruption and no medium-term readiness gains after replacements.
