      Quarantine/blockade and other gray-zone coercion are more likely near-term PRC approaches against Taiwan than full-scale amphibious invasion.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track major PRC coercive actions 2026–2027; classify events into quarantine/blockade, gray-zone harassment, or invasion-scale mobilization;
      compare frequencies and triggers.
    assumptions:
      - Observable actions are a usable proxy for PRC scenario choice.
    falsifiers:
      - A major amphibious invasion attempt begins in the near term.
      - Credible internal evidence indicates invasion was the primary near-term plan.

      PLA ADIZ incursions around Taiwan increased from about 1,669 in 2023 to about 3,615 in 2024.

    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify against Taiwan MND or reputable OSINT aggregations that define and count ADIZ incursions consistently year-over-year.
    assumptions:
      - Counts are comparable across years (consistent definition and data source).
    falsifiers:
      - Trusted datasets show materially different annual totals under consistent definitions.

      Median-line crossings in the Taiwan Strait occurred on about 209 days in 2024 versus about 62 days in 2023.

    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify day-counts from Taiwan MND or reputable OSINT datasets with a clear definition of 'median-line crossing day'.
    assumptions:
      - A day-based measure is computed consistently across years.
    falsifiers:
      - Trusted datasets show materially different day counts.

      Taiwan’s current “porcupine strategy” is better optimized for deterring/defeating an amphibious invasion than for countering a quarantine or blockade.

    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare Taiwan defense investments and exercise outcomes across invasion vs quarantine/blockade scenarios in war games and operational assessments.
    assumptions:
      - Relative scenario preparedness can be assessed via exercises and capability inventories.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible assessments show Taiwan is equally or more prepared for blockade/quarantine than for invasion.

      Taiwan relies on imports for over 97% of its energy needs.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "RESOURCE"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.85
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Confirm with Taiwan energy-balance statistics (or consistent secondary sources) for the relevant year.
    assumptions: []
    falsifiers:
      - Official energy-balance data shows materially lower import dependence.

      Taiwan has roughly 11–14 days of LNG reserves under normal consumption.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "RESOURCE"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Define the reserve metric (terminal storage vs national stockpile vs power-sector burn rate) and validate against official reserve reporting
      or CSIS wargame inputs.
    assumptions:
      - A stable 'normal consumption' baseline is meaningful for estimating days-of-cover.
    falsifiers:
      - Authoritative reserve figures show substantially different days-of-cover.

      U.S. sovereignty-violating precedents (e.g., Venezuela intervention) and Greenland-related threats weaken Washington’s legitimacy as a defender
      of the rules-based order, potentially lowering expected international resistance to PRC coercion against Taiwan.

    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.50
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track coalition statements, UN voting patterns, sanctions, and defense cooperation commitments following such precedents, and compare to prior
      baseline behavior.
    assumptions:
      - Normative credibility measurably affects coalition coordination in crises.
    falsifiers:
      - Post-incident behavior shows stronger coordinated norm-enforcement than prior baselines.
