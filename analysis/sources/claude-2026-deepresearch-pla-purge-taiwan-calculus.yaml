      Quarantine/blockade and other gray-zone coercion are more likely near-term PRC approaches against Taiwan than full-scale amphibious invasion.

    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["claude-2026-deepresearch-pla-purge-taiwan-calculus"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track major PRC coercive actions 2026–2027; classify events into quarantine/blockade, gray-zone harassment, or invasion-scale mobilization;
      compare frequencies and triggers.
    assumptions:
      - Observable actions are a usable proxy for PRC scenario choice.
    falsifiers:
      - A major amphibious invasion attempt begins in the near term.
      - Credible internal evidence indicates invasion was the primary near-term plan.

      Re-aggregate annual totals from Taiwan MND primary releases/datasets with a documented counting rule to confirm year-over-year comparability.
    assumptions:
      - Taiwan MND counting rules are consistent across years (or differences are immaterial to the annual totals).
    falsifiers:
      - A primary MND aggregation under consistent definitions yields materially different yearly totals.

      Days in 2024 when over half of detected PLA aircraft crossed the Taiwan Strait median line rose to about 209, versus about 62 days in 2023.

    operationalization: >-
      Recompute the “>50% crossing day” metric from Taiwan MND’s published time series/daily releases and compare annual day counts for 2023 vs 2024.
    assumptions:
      - The “detected aircraft” denominator is defined consistently across years.
    falsifiers:
      - A primary-data recomputation yields materially different annual day counts.

      Taiwan’s current “porcupine strategy” is better optimized for deterring/defeating an amphibious invasion than for countering a quarantine or blockade.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare Taiwan defense investments and exercise outcomes across invasion vs quarantine/blockade scenarios in war games and operational assessments.
    assumptions:
      - Relative scenario preparedness can be assessed via exercises and capability inventories.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible assessments show Taiwan is equally or more prepared for blockade/quarantine than for invasion.

      Taiwan relies on imports for over 97% of its energy needs.

      Confirm with Taiwan energy-balance statistics (or consistent secondary sources) for the relevant year.
    assumptions: []
    falsifiers:
      - Official energy-balance data shows materially lower import dependence.

      Taiwan’s natural gas reserves were equivalent to about 10 to 11 days of local consumption (as of 2022-08).

    operationalization: >-
      Identify the underlying reserve reporting method (inventory definition and demand baseline) and reconcile with Energy Administration “security stockpile” requirement concepts.
    assumptions:
      - The quoted “days of consumption” figure reflects a comparable, system-wide inventory measure.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary MOEA reporting for the period shows materially different gas days-of-cover under the same definition.

      U.S. sovereignty-violating precedents (e.g., Venezuela intervention) and Greenland-related threats weaken Washington’s legitimacy as a defender
      of the rules-based order, potentially lowering expected international resistance to PRC coercion against Taiwan.

    operationalization: >-
      Track coalition statements, UN voting patterns, sanctions, and defense cooperation commitments following such precedents, and compare to prior
      baseline behavior.
    assumptions:
      - Normative credibility measurably affects coalition coordination in crises.
    falsifiers:
      - Post-incident behavior shows stronger coordinated norm-enforcement than prior baselines.
