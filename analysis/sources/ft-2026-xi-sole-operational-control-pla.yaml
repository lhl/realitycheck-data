      Strong contextualization of CCP “discipline” language and analyst views; still limited by opaque PRC internal motives.

      The investigation of Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli leaves Xi Jinping with unusually direct (effectively sole)
      operational control over the PLA via a drastically reduced Central Military Commission.

      Compare formal CMC membership, acting appointments, and observed command-and-control functioning (exercise tempo,
      theater-command activity) before/after the purge to estimate any operational-control bottlenecks.
    assumptions:
      - Operational control is sufficiently centralized at the CMC level that vacancies materially matter.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows stable operational command functioning with acting leaders filling roles seamlessly.

      In CCP political language, “discipline violations” commonly denotes corruption but is also intertwined with factional
      struggle and has historically been used by party leaders to purge rivals.

    operationalization: >-
      Analyze a corpus of CCP disciplinary announcements and outcomes to test whether “discipline” cases correlate with
      factional-network removal patterns beyond pure corruption indicators.
    assumptions:
      - Factional-network structure can be inferred from public career histories.
    falsifiers:
      - “Discipline violations” cases show no association with factional patterns after controlling for corruption signals.

      The investigations of Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli likely reflect concerns about underperformance in building credible
      combat capability and inefficient use of defense resources, not only corruption.

    operationalization: >-
      Look for PRC internal messaging emphasizing training shortcomings and combat readiness; assess whether purge targets
      disproportionately occupy roles tied to operations/training/procurement performance.
    assumptions:
      - Purge decisions partially reflect performance evaluation.
    falsifiers:
      - Subsequent disclosures show the probe rationale is unrelated to readiness/performance.

      U.S. and Taiwanese government statements commonly describe Xi Jinping as having directed the PLA to be capable of taking
      Taiwan by force by 2027 (a capability target, not a guaranteed decision-to-invade date).

    operationalization: >-
      Collect primary U.S./Taiwan official statements and testimony referencing “2027” and classify whether they describe an
      assessed capability objective versus an invasion plan/timeline.
    assumptions:
      - Public statements reflect underlying intelligence assessments.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary statements do not support the “directed by 2027” framing.
