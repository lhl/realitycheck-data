      Narrative tech journalism synthesizing multiple sources (HBR, METR, NBER, HN comment). Strong at surfacing
      a coherent framing and representative quotes; weaker as primary evidence for causal effects or prevalence.

      When AI lowers the friction of doing tasks, workers’ task lists and work scope can expand to fill the time
      freed (and then exceed it), creating workload creep and burnout risk even absent explicit new targets.

    operationalization: >-
      Track per-worker task counts, cross-role task acquisition, and after-hours micro-work before/after AI adoption;
      test whether “time saved” correlates with “scope added” and burnout scales.
    assumptions:
      - Time saved is not fully reinvested into recovery by default.
    falsifiers:
      - Most organizations show reduced scope and increased recovery after AI adoption.

      In NBER Working Paper 33777 on AI chatbots in Denmark, occupation-wide surveys show modest gains
      (about ~3% time savings for the typical user) and linked administrative labor records show null net effects
      on earnings and recorded hours (ruling out effects larger than ~2% two years after).

    source_ids: ["techcrunch-2026-ai-adopter-burnout"]
    operationalization: >-
      Reproduce the paper’s survey-to-admin linkage and difference-in-differences estimates; verify time-savings
      construction and confidence intervals on earnings/hours outcomes.
    assumptions:
      - Survey responses are representative and link cleanly to admin records.
    falsifiers:
      - Paper revisions materially change time-savings estimates or find significant earnings/hours effects.

    text: >-
      AI-driven burnout risk can increase even when AI produces real augmentation gains, because organizational
      expectations for speed and responsiveness can rise, making work harder to step away from.

    operationalization: >-
      Measure changes in response-time expectations (SLA norms, message latency pressure), boundary violations
      (after-hours messages), and burnout outcomes before/after AI adoption controlling for workload volume.
    assumptions:
      - Expectation shifts are measurable and precede burnout changes.
    falsifiers:
      - AI adoption correlates with lower responsiveness pressure and reduced burnout in comparable settings.
