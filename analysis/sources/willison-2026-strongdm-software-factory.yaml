      Enthusiastic practitioner commentary with quotes and links; relies on a demo + StrongDM’s self-description.
      High signal for “what is being claimed and how it is framed,” weaker as evidence for effectiveness or generality.

      The `strongdm/attractor` repository contains no implementation code and instead publishes natural-language
      specifications (Markdown) plus instructions to implement Attractor using a modern coding agent.

    operationalization: >-
      Periodically snapshot repo contents and diff file types/structure; classify whether it remains “spec-only”
      or evolves into an implementation.
    assumptions:
      - GitHub snapshots accurately reflect the intended public artifact.
    falsifiers:
      - Repository evolves into a conventional code implementation with specs as ancillary.

    text: >-
      In “software factory” workflows, natural-language specs and validation scenarios become the primary
      governance surface, while code becomes an intermediate artifact produced (and potentially regenerated)
      by agents.

    operationalization: >-
      Observe organizations adopting spec-driven agent loops and measure artifact primacy: what gets reviewed,
      versioned, and used for acceptance (specs/scenarios vs code diffs).
    assumptions:
      - Specs/scenarios can be kept aligned with actual system behavior.
    falsifiers:
      - Code review and manual debugging remain the dominant governance mechanism even in agent-heavy teams.

    text: >-
      As agentic “dark factory” workflows mature, software engineers will increasingly shift from writing code
      to building and semi-monitoring the systems (harnesses, loops, tooling) that generate code.

    operationalization: >-
      Track job postings and internal role definitions over 2026–2028 for growth in “agent harness/orchestration”
      roles and declining share of roles centered on manual implementation.
    assumptions:
      - Autonomy and validation tooling improve enough to make monitoring/harness roles valuable.
    falsifiers:
      - No meaningful labor-market shift occurs despite continued improvements in agentic coding tools.
