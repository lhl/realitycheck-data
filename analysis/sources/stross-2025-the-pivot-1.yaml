      A significant share of current social unrest and insecurity-driven
      radicalization is being caused by the ongoing civilizational energy
      transition.

    operationalization: >-
      Define “energy-transition stress” proxies (energy-price volatility, fossil
      sector job losses, rapid policy shifts) and test whether they predict
      radicalization proxies (extremist vote share, hate crimes, political
      violence) across regions/time after controlling for confounders.
    assumptions:
      - Energy-transition pressures are large relative to other drivers.
    falsifiers:
      - Comparable radicalization trends occur without transition-related stress.
      - Stronger predictors dominate and remove transition effect.

      Track global primary energy shares and emissions trajectories; “irreversible”
      implies no sustained multi-year reversal toward higher fossil share after
      accounting for shocks (war/recession/weather).
    falsifiers:
      - Sustained multi-year reversal toward higher fossil share and emissions.

      Use a published PV module price index series (e.g., NREL/IEA/Our World in Data)
      to confirm historical price points and the post-2012 trend.
    falsifiers:
      - Price series does not support the stated historical values/trend.

    operationalization: >-
      Confirm via Eurostat/ENTSO-E/Ember monthly generation share that renewables
      exceeded 50% for the EU by ~Aug/Sep 2025.
    falsifiers:
      - Official generation shares do not cross 50% by that date.

      In the post-oil era, energy production will be more widely distributed
      rather than concentrated in resource-extraction economies and centralized
      power stations.

      Track distributed generation share (rooftop/community solar), concentration
      metrics (e.g., HHI by generation ownership), and shifts in net energy
      exporter/importer status over 2025–2040.
    falsifiers:
      - New generation remains highly centralized and concentrated.

      Global fossil-fuel energy use has probably already passed peak oil and
      peak carbon, and is now trending inexorably downward (voluntarily into
      net-zero/renewables or involuntarily into catastrophe).

    source_ids: ["stross-2025-the-pivot-1"]
    operationalization: >-
      Use annual global oil consumption and CO₂ emissions series; “passed peak”
      implies the historical maximum occurs in ≤2025 and is followed by sustained
      declines over the next 5–10 years.
    falsifiers:
      - New multi-year highs occur after 2025 with no sustained decline.

      The forecast boom in small modular nuclear reactors will fizzle as cheap
      distributed solar PV plus battery storage scales.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare SMR deployment counts/capacity and levelized costs versus forecasts
      through ~2035; “fizzle” implies widespread cancellations, delays, and lack
      of cost-competitive scale relative to PV+storage.

      By 2040, large fractions of proved fossil reserves remain unburned and
      associated extraction rights experience major write-downs/impairments or
      legal prohibitions that prevent monetization.

      The energy transition is producing major political consequences—from
      bribery and corruption up to open warfare—and post-oil geopolitics will
      differ substantially from the oil-centric post-1945 era.

      historical oil-centric conflict patterns.

      Specify whether “passed” means annual exceedance or multi-decade average.
      Measure global mean warming relative to 1850–1900 and quantify crop-relevant

      The hyperscale AI data center boom resembles a bubble; to the extent LLMs are
