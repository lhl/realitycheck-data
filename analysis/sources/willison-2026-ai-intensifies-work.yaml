      Short practitioner post pointing to an HBR piece plus personal anecdotes about attention depletion and
      difficulty stopping. High signal for “what a power-user reports feeling,” low signal for prevalence and
      causal identification.

      For some heavy LLM users, AI-enabled parallel throughput (multiple work threads/projects/agents at once)
      can be psychologically exhausting: perceived productivity rises while mental energy depletes rapidly.

    operationalization: >-
      Combine time-use telemetry (AI prompting, task switching) with fatigue/energy self-reports; test whether
      parallel thread count and checking frequency predict depletion independent of total hours.
    assumptions:
      - Self-reported exhaustion tracks meaningful cognitive depletion.
    falsifiers:
      - Observational studies find no relationship between AI-driven parallelism/checking and fatigue.

      Rapid AI feedback loops can create “one more prompt” dynamics that reduce sleep for some users
      (continued late-night work because the next increment feels immediately reachable).

    source_ids: ["willison-2026-ai-intensifies-work"]
    operationalization: >-
      Survey and instrument sleep and late-night AI activity among heavy users; test whether late prompting/agent
      runs predict delayed bedtimes and reduced sleep duration.
    assumptions:
      - Late-night AI use is not fully confounded by independent deadline pressure.
    falsifiers:
      - No measurable correlation between AI prompting patterns and sleep disruption in heavy-user cohorts.

      Organizations can benefit from explicit norms and standards for AI use (“AI practice”) to reduce burnout risk
      and to help distinguish genuine productivity gains from unsustainable intensity.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare organizations/teams with explicit AI-use norms (pauses, sequencing, boundary rules) against matched
      controls on burnout, retention, incident rates, and sustained output over multiple quarters.
    assumptions:
      - Norms translate into behavior change despite incentive pressures.
    falsifiers:
      - No measurable differences in burnout/quality/retention between norm-adopting and control teams.
