      Self-grading by the original forecasters. Strengths: unusually concrete metrics + a published
      grading spreadsheet. Risks: selection effects (which metrics count), definitional drift (“what counts
      as SOTA”), and circularity where “resolution” uses the authors’ own later model estimates. Treat
      quantitative rows as their best-effort scoring, not independent ground truth.

      The AI Futures Project reports that, using category aggregation, quantitative progress vs AI 2027
      is at roughly 0.58–0.66× pace (summarized as ~65%).

      Recompute the category means/medians from the published grading spreadsheet (captured) and confirm
      the reported aggregate range.
    assumptions:
      - The grading spreadsheet’s aggregation rows match the post’s stated method.
    falsifiers:
      - Recomputing the aggregates from the spreadsheet does not yield values in the stated range.

    text: >-
      The AI Futures Project reports that aggregating over individual prediction rows yields higher aggregates
      (mean ~0.75×, median ~0.84×), but argues this is a worse indicator because compute predictions are 7 of 15 rows.

      Count compute-related rows in the grading spreadsheet and reproduce mean/median across individual rows.
    assumptions:
      - The set of rows included as 'individual predictions' is stable and clearly defined.
    falsifiers:
      - Row counts or mean/median aggregates do not match the post.

      The AI Futures Project predicts that if progress continues at ~0.65× of the AI 2027 pace, the scenario’s takeoff
      would shift to late-2027 through mid-2029.

    operationalization: >-
      Define the original AI 2027 takeoff window and apply a consistent time-rescaling using the stated pace multiplier;
      compare to the post’s window.
    assumptions:
      - A single scalar pace multiplier is meaningful across the whole takeoff sequence.
    falsifiers:
      - The mapping from the pace multiplier to dates is inconsistent with the post or depends on omitted assumptions.

      The AI Futures Project predicts that after adjusting for compute/labor slowdowns using the AI Futures Model, takeoff
      would shift to mid-2028 through mid-2030.

    operationalization: >-
      Reproduce the AI Futures Model timing adjustment described in the post (with/without slowdown links) and confirm the
      implied timing range.
    assumptions:
      - The slowdown adjustment procedure is implemented as described.
    falsifiers:
      - The model outputs under the stated procedure do not match the timing range.
