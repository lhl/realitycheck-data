      A PLA Daily editorial about the Zhang Youxia/Liu Zhenli case accuses them of undermining the “CMC Chairman Responsibility System”
      and of fueling political and corruption issues affecting the party’s absolute leadership over the military and combat capability.

      Quote the PLA Daily editorial text and classify the emphasis on political authority, cliques, and combat capability impacts.
    assumptions:

      Reporting summarized by Sinocism (via SCMP sources) claims party elites were briefed about the investigation and that Zhang Youxia
      was accused of corruption and of failing to rein in associates, family members, and relatives, including failing to report problems
      promptly to party leadership.

    operationalization: >-
      Seek corroboration from multiple independent outlets or subsequent authoritative disclosures; track whether official narratives
      later emphasize “family/associates” and reporting failures.
    assumptions:
      - SCMP sources were accurately reported and not part of a deliberate misinformation effort.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible later reporting contradicts these allegations or attributes the case to unrelated issues.

    text: >-
      Reporting summarized by Sinocism (via a SCMP-sourced claim) states that Zhang Youxia was formally detained by military corruption
      investigators shortly before the public announcement.

      Track corroborating reports about detention timing and whether Zhang appears in public after the alleged detention date.
    assumptions:
      - The SCMP-sourced detention claim reflects real internal action.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible reporting shows Zhang was not detained on that timeline.

      The unusually fast official confirmation of the case suggests PRC leadership urgency to get ahead of rumors and quickly begin the
      propaganda and political-education process inside the PLA.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare purge-case timelines and look for accompanying internal political-education campaigns (PLA Daily campaigns, study sessions)
      that accelerate immediately after fast confirmations versus slower cases.
    assumptions:
      - Timing is strategically chosen for narrative control rather than purely administrative.
    falsifiers:
      - Timing patterns are consistent with routine investigation pipeline stages and not followed by unusually rapid political education.
