      Internal synthesis memo combining primary sources, benchmark checks, and subjective weighting. Strength: explicit pace
      scorecard and separation of “inputs vs outputs vs autonomy.” Risks: selective metric choice, reliance on secondary benchmark
      snapshots, and subjective aggregation/weights. Treat as hypothesis-generating synthesis, not a primary measurement source.

      An internal independent scorecard memo estimates overall pace vs the original AI 2027 schedule at ~0.70× (sensitivity
      ~0.62×–0.78×), concluding progress is behind schedule overall as of 2026-02-13.

    operationalization: >-
      Reproduce the memo’s weighted pace score using the same inputs/weights and assess sensitivity to alternative weighting and
      updated benchmark values.
    assumptions:
      - The memo’s selected metrics and weights are reasonable proxies for AI 2027’s core causal levers.
    falsifiers:
      - Reproduction fails or yields a materially different pace estimate given the same inputs/weights.

      An internal independent scorecard memo argues that by early 2026, compute/capex inputs are ahead of AI 2027 expectations,
      benchmark outputs are mixed, and full-stack autonomy/productivity evidence lags (overall: autonomy behind).

    operationalization: >-
      Define input/output/autonomy indicators and score them against AI 2027’s dated expectations with explicit cutoffs; compare
      to memo’s qualitative conclusion.
    assumptions:
      - Autonomy/productivity is the binding bottleneck for an AI 2027-style rapid takeoff path.
    falsifiers:
      - Robust autonomy/productivity indicators are clearly ahead of schedule on multiple independent measures.
