      Use China’s published defense budget series (in RMB) and compute ratio from Xi’s first year to 2026; report whether the
      ratio is ≥2× and note nominal vs real adjustments.
    assumptions:
      - Official defense budget figures are comparable across years.
    falsifiers:
      - Series shows <2× change under comparable definitions.

      Western reporting frequently cites U.S. intelligence assessments that Xi Jinping directed the PLA to be ready by 2027 for
      a Taiwan operation (often framed as an invasion-readiness objective rather than a committed invasion plan).

    operationalization: >-
      Collect primary U.S. official statements and testimony referencing “2027” and classify whether they claim “ready to invade”
      versus “capable/ready objective”; track any later revisions.
    assumptions:
      - Public references reflect real intelligence assessments.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary sources do not support the “ready by 2027” framing.

      The hollowing out of the PLA’s senior leadership makes a Taiwan invasion-scale contingency infeasible in the near term,
      plausibly delaying any attempt to seize Taiwan by force for multiple years.

    operationalization: >-
      Track invasion-relevant indicators (amphibious lift readiness, joint-force exercises, logistics mobilization) and compare
      changes against leadership replacement timelines.
    assumptions:
      - High-command continuity is a binding constraint on invasion planning and execution.
    falsifiers:
      - Invasion indicators rise strongly despite leadership turnover.

      The rolling, multi-year pattern of PLA purges suggests Xi Jinping is not reacting to an imminent coup threat and instead
      indicates confidence and strength in his control over the military.

    source_ids: ["telegraph-2026-xi-purge-total-control-pla"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare purge tempo and breadth across regimes known to face imminent coup risk versus routine consolidation; assess whether
      coup-threat cases show sharper, more synchronized purges.
    assumptions:
      - Purge tempo is informative about perceived coup risk.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows rolling purges are common responses to coup fears due to investigation pipeline constraints.
