      Political news outlet; reporting mixes factual timeline with heavy use of historical analogy (“Fort Sumter”) and risk
      framing (“civil war”). Most valuable for: (a) stated positions/quotes, (b) pointer links to underlying artifacts, and
      (c) mapping actor framings around the Minnesota escalation.
