      A ChatGPT-generated research memo proposes an independent replication plan for the AI Futures Project’s AI 2027
      self-grading: reproduce pace multipliers per metric and compare category-aggregation vs individual-row aggregation.

      Apply the memo’s replication plan to the captured grading CSV and document deviations due to cutoff/definition choices.
    assumptions:
      - Independent replication can be performed from the published spreadsheet and cited sources.
    falsifiers:
      - Key pace multipliers are not reproducible from the published materials (without hidden data).

      A ChatGPT-generated research memo argues that resolving AI 2027’s 'AI software R&D uplift' predictions using a later
      estimate from the authors’ own model risks circularity without external empirical validation.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "META"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["gpt-2026-02-13-ai-2027-review"]
    operationalization: >-
      Inspect the grading spreadsheet’s uplift rows and classify resolution inputs as external measurements vs endogenous
      model estimates.
    assumptions:
      - Endogenous model estimates are epistemically weaker than external measurements for 'grading' a forecast.
    falsifiers:
      - The uplift resolution is based on external measured uplift rather than authors’ later model estimates.
