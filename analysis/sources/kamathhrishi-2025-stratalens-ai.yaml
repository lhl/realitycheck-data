      Single-maintainer repo for a live product; detailed architecture docs but limited independent validation.
      Benchmark claim is self-reported and no eval artifacts are provided in-repo. Repository licensing appears
      inconsistent (README claims MIT but no LICENSE file found).

      StrataLens AI uses a traditional hybrid RAG architecture: PostgreSQL with pgvector embeddings plus keyword search
      and reranking, and includes LLM-based routing for SEC filing sections and table selection.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E2"
    credence: 0.85
    source_ids: ["kamathhrishi-2025-stratalens-ai"]
    operationalization: "Inspect repository docs and code to confirm retrieval components and configured weights/models."
    assumptions:
      - Documentation accurately reflects the deployed system.
    falsifiers:
      - Code/docs show a materially different retrieval approach (e.g., no pgvector, no hybrid search, no reranking).

      The StrataLens README claims about 85% accuracy on FinanceBench (SEC filings only), evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["kamathhrishi-2025-stratalens-ai"]
    operationalization: "Locate the claim in README and request or reproduce evaluation artifacts under a specified protocol."
    assumptions:
      - The author’s stated benchmark corresponds to a real evaluation run.
    falsifiers:
      - No evaluation can be produced, or reproduction fails under a clearly specified FinanceBench subset/protocol.

      The stratalens-ai repository lacks a LICENSE file despite stating “MIT License” in the README, so the licensing
      status is unclear.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E2"
    credence: 0.95
    source_ids: ["kamathhrishi-2025-stratalens-ai"]
    operationalization: "Check repository root and GitHub license metadata for an explicit license grant."
    assumptions:
      - Absence of an explicit license implies no clear permission to reuse beyond default copyright.
    falsifiers:
      - A LICENSE file exists or a clear license grant is published in the repo/history and reflected in metadata.
