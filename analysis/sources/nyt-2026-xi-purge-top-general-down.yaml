      Xi’s psychology and readiness impacts. Treat roster-count and motive claims as provisional unless independently verified.

      In modern PRC political practice, senior officials publicly placed “under investigation” for serious discipline/law
      violations are rarely later declared innocent; public investigation strongly predicts removal.

    operationalization: >-
      Build a dataset of public investigation announcements and final outcomes for senior PRC officials (PLA + civilian)
      and measure exoneration/restoration rates.
    assumptions:
      - Publicly announced investigations are comparable across time and office types.
    falsifiers:
      - Exoneration/restoration after public investigation is common.

      One plausible driver of Xi Jinping’s repeated PLA purges is personal insecurity and distrust of top commanders, such
      that perceived trustworthiness outweighs personal ties to long-time allies.

    operationalization: >-
      Look for internal PRC signals emphasizing leader insecurity (coup narratives, loyalty campaigns) and for purge
      targets disproportionately drawn from historically “trusted” or close-tie networks.
    assumptions:
      - Psychological motives are inferable from observable purge patterns and propaganda emphasis.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows purges are primarily performance/corruption-driven with no special targeting of trusted allies.

      A roster analysis cited in reporting suggests that among 44 uniformed officers appointed to the CCP Central Committee
      in 2022, roughly 29 were purged or missing by late 2025/early 2026.

      Reproduce the calculation using official lists of Central Committee members and documented purges/disappearances.
    assumptions:
      - The cited roster and classification (“purged or missing”) are applied consistently.
    falsifiers:
      - Reproduced counts differ materially under the same definitions.

      A substantial share of senior PLA officers removed in the recent purge wave were promoted during Xi Jinping’s tenure,
      implying corruption/loyalty problems among Xi’s own appointees, not only predecessors’ networks.

    operationalization: >-
      For each removed officer, identify who promoted/appointed them and the timing relative to Xi’s tenure; compute the share
      of removals among Xi-era appointees vs earlier cohorts.
    assumptions:
      - Promotions/appointments can be inferred reliably from public career histories.
    falsifiers:
      - Most removals are concentrated in pre-Xi appointment networks under comparable definitions.

      Rebuilding the PLA’s top chains of command after repeated purges may take roughly five years or longer, lowering the
      short-term probability of a major cross-strait attack on Taiwan.

      Track replacement timelines, exercise complexity, and joint-command performance indicators over 2026–2031; compare whether
      invasion-relevant training/logistics indicators recover quickly or remain depressed.
    assumptions:
      - Leadership experience and cohesion are binding constraints for invasion-scale joint operations.
    falsifiers:
      - Rapid replacement and stable/increasing invasion indicators within 1–2 years post-purge.
