    operationalization: >-
      Re-aggregate annual totals from Taiwan MND primary releases/datasets with a documented counting rule to confirm
      year-over-year comparability.
    assumptions:
      - Taiwan MND counting rules are consistent across years (or differences are immaterial to the annual totals).
    falsifiers:
      - A primary MND aggregation under consistent definitions yields materially different yearly totals.
