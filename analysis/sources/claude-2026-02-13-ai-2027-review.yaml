      A Claude-generated verification memo claims the AI Futures Project’s Dec 2025 update represents a ~3–5 year retreat from
      the original AI 2027 timing, driven primarily by modeling corrections rather than new empirical evidence.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare the AI Futures Project’s Apr 2025 vs Dec 2025 stated medians and their attributed reasons for change (modeling vs evidence).
    assumptions:
      - The memo’s paraphrase accurately reflects the primary update’s attribution.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary sources attribute the shift mainly to new empirical evidence rather than modeling changes.
