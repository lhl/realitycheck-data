      Conversation plus self-report by a frontier-lab CEO; incentives to project confidence (timelines, revenue
      growth) and to justify strategic/policy stances (export controls, “values-first” alignment). Transcript is
      useful for stated beliefs and internal framing, not as audited evidence for financials or capability milestones.

      “Big Blob of Compute” hypothesis: capability scaling is driven primarily by raw compute, data quantity and
      quality/distribution, training time, scalable objective functions (pretraining and RL), and numerical
      stability, while bespoke “cleverness” matters less.

    operationalization: >-
      Hold compute/data roughly constant across comparable model families and measure marginal returns from
      algorithmic innovations versus scale changes; test whether RL scaling curves show predictable returns with
      increased training/compute on diverse tasks.
    assumptions:
      - Comparable “compute budgets” and “data quality” can be operationalized across runs.
    falsifiers:
      - Algorithmic changes dominate scaling outcomes under matched compute/data, or RL scaling does not show predictable returns.

      Amodei assigns roughly 90% probability that we reach a “country of geniuses in a data center” within about
      10 years (by around 2035), with major delays driven primarily by exogenous disruptions (e.g., geopolitical
      shocks affecting chip fabs).

    source_ids: ["dwarkesh-2026-amodei-end-of-exponential"]
    operationalization: >-
      Define measurable criteria for “country of geniuses” (broad superhuman competence, autonomy, scalable
      instances, tool use) and assess existence by 2035-12-31 using public, third-party, or auditable evidence.
    assumptions:
      - The threshold is observable (not purely internal) and can be audited.
    falsifiers:
      - No deployed system meets the threshold by 2035-12-31.

      For verifiable domains like coding, Amodei expects end-to-end coding capability in roughly 1–2 years and
      regards “not within 10 years” as implausible.

      Evaluate models/agents on end-to-end software engineering tasks (setup, coding, testing, debugging,
      deployment) under realistic constraints, tracking success rates and time-to-completion through 2028.
    assumptions:
      - “End-to-end coding” can be benchmarked without excessive scaffold bias.
    falsifiers:
      - By 2028-12-31, success rates remain low on realistic end-to-end SWE tasks.

      Amodei reports Anthropic revenue grew roughly 10× per year: 2023 ($0→$100M), 2024 ($100M→$1B), 2025
      ($1B→$9–10B), plus “another few billion” added in January 2026.

    source_ids: ["dwarkesh-2026-amodei-end-of-exponential"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify via audited financial statements, investor disclosures, or multiple independent credible reports; ensure
      consistent definition of “revenue” and time windowing.
    assumptions:
      - “Revenue” is defined consistently across years in the claim.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible audited reporting materially contradicts these figures.

      Even “country of geniuses in a data center” will not be an “infinitely compelling” product; diffusion and
      integration constraints imply extremely fast but bounded revenue growth, not arbitrarily large instantaneous
      adoption.

    source_ids: ["dwarkesh-2026-amodei-end-of-exponential"]
    operationalization: >-
      Model adoption curves for enterprise AI deployments; estimate friction from integration, security/compliance,
      and loop-closing reliability; test whether these frictions remain binding as capability improves.
    assumptions:
      - Adoption frictions can be measured and are not fully eliminated by capability improvements.
    falsifiers:
      - Adoption saturates near-instantly once capability reaches certain thresholds, showing minimal diffusion constraints.

      The API model remains a durable AI business model because rapid capability progress creates a constantly
      renewing frontier of new use cases; multiple business models will coexist, including “pay for results” and
      labor-like compensation schemes.

    source_ids: ["dwarkesh-2026-amodei-end-of-exponential"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track revenue mix over time across AI vendors (API vs integrated products vs outcomes-based contracts); test
      whether API usage remains resilient as capabilities and productization increase.
    assumptions:
      - “API vs product” boundaries remain meaningful and measurable in vendor reporting.
    falsifiers:
      - API usage becomes a small, declining share without a persistent experimentation frontier.

      Policy stance: do not sell chips, datacenters, or chipmaking capability to China; selectively diffuse benefits
      (e.g., cures) while restricting compute infrastructure; build datacenters in places like Africa provided they
      are not China-owned.

    operationalization: >-
      Evaluate feasibility of separating “benefits” diffusion from compute diffusion; measure leakage rates, enforcement
      costs, retaliation, and security outcomes under selective-export regimes.
    assumptions:
      - Compute infrastructure diffusion can be controlled more tightly than end-user benefit diffusion.
    falsifiers:
      - Selective diffusion is not enforceable at meaningful scales or is net-destabilizing.
