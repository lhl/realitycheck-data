      First-party OpenAI system card describing safety evaluations, product mitigations (Codex sandboxing/network
      controls), and Preparedness Framework determinations for GPT-5.3-Codex, with a strong focus on cyber
      “High capability” safeguards (including Trusted Access for Cyber and monitoring/routing controls). Includes
      some third-party evaluation reporting (e.g., Apollo Research), but many core assessments remain internal and
      are not fully reproducible; incentives favor justifying deployment and safeguards sufficiency.

      OpenAI claims GPT-5.3-Codex is the most capable agentic coding model to date and can take on long-running
      tasks involving research, tool use, and complex execution while remaining steerable without losing context.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare GPT-5.3-Codex against peer frontier coding agents on standardized long-horizon coding tasks under a
      common scaffold and resource budget; measure “steerability without losing context” via controlled
      interruption/redirect experiments.
    assumptions:
      - “Most capable” is intended to mean broadly across agentic coding tasks, not narrowly under OpenAI’s stack.
    falsifiers:
      - Independent evaluations under comparable scaffolds show multiple models outperform GPT-5.3-Codex on
        long-horizon coding without materially worse steerability.

      OpenAI states Codex agents operate in isolated sandboxes: cloud agents run in isolated containers with
      network access disabled by default; local Codex runs commands in OS-level sandboxes (macOS Seatbelt, Linux
      seccomp+landlock, Windows sandbox/WSL), restricting edits to the workspace by default, with optional user
      approval for unsandboxed execution.

      OpenAI reports GPT-5.3-Codex was trained to avoid data-destructive actions (e.g., rm -rf, git clean -xfd,
      git reset --hard, push --force) by using RL rollouts with a “user model” that makes conflicting edits and
      rewarding the model for not reverting user-produced changes; OpenAI also reports improved performance on a
      destructive-actions avoidance evaluation (0.88 for GPT-5.3-Codex vs 0.76 for GPT-5.2-Codex).
