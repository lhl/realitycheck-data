      Practitioner polemic with explicit exaggeration and humor. Hosted on a vendor blog (Sourcegraph), includes
      business framing and strong calls to action. Useful for extracting mental models, proposed timelines, and
      “what might matter,” but weak as empirical evidence for adoption rates, costs, or macroeconomic impacts.

      Agentic coding will progress rapidly from coding agents to “agent clusters” and then “agent fleets,” where
      supervisory agents manage pods of coding agents and humans manage the resulting systems.

    operationalization: >-
      Track the number of concurrently running agents used by typical developers (telemetry, surveys) and
      classify whether “cluster/fleet” patterns (dozens+ agents with supervisory layers) become mainstream.
    assumptions:
      - Tooling will enable safe parallelism without overwhelming supervision demands.
    falsifiers:
      - By 2026–2027, most agent usage remains single-agent or low-parallelism with no supervisory layer.

      Coding agents cost roughly $10–$12 per hour at March 2025 “current rates” due to token burn.

    operationalization: >-
      Measure effective hourly costs from historical model pricing and typical agent token consumption on
      comparable coding tasks, including tool calls and retries.
    assumptions:
      - Session token usage distributions are stable enough to estimate typical costs.
    falsifiers:
      - Historical measurements show typical costs materially outside the $10–$12/hour range.

    text: >-
      As developers run multiple agents in parallel (“agent clusters”), token spend becomes a major opex line
      item and creates a “pay-to-play” stratification across firms.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare firm-level output and cycle time to LLM spend intensity across similar domains; test whether
      higher spend causally predicts sustained competitive advantage after controlling for confounders.
    assumptions:
      - Spend can be measured reliably at the team or firm level.
    falsifiers:
      - Firms with low spend remain competitive on comparable deliverables and quality.

      In the near term, the job of software developers will shift away from direct coding and toward
      supervising dashboards of many coding agents and their AI supervisors.

      Analyze time-allocation data and job descriptions over 2025–2027 for growth in “agent operations /
      orchestration / supervision” responsibilities relative to direct implementation work.
    assumptions:
      - Agent tooling becomes reliable enough that supervision is a stable role rather than constant firefighting.
    falsifiers:
      - Most engineering roles remain dominated by direct coding and traditional review by 2026–2027.

    text: >-
      Junior developers will gain leverage as coding agents spread because they adopt AI faster on average and
      are cheaper, leading firms reallocating budgets toward token spend to retain juniors over senior AI holdouts.

      Compare AI-tool adoption rates by tenure with hiring/layoff patterns and compensation bands in 2025–2027,
      controlling for role criticality and domain risk.
    assumptions:
      - Adoption differences by tenure are large enough to influence staffing decisions.
    falsifiers:
      - Layoffs and hiring show no association with tenure-based AI adoption patterns.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare macro forecasts and realized growth to plausible diffusion models of agent productivity, accounting
      for bottlenecks (capital, regulation, coordination, demand).
    assumptions:
      - Agent productivity improvements diffuse broadly and translate into measured output.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible modeling and subsequent data show impacts far below 100% within the relevant horizon.
