    operationalization: >-
      Identify the underlying reserve reporting method (inventory definition and demand baseline) and reconcile with
      Energy Administration “security stockpile” requirement concepts.
    assumptions:
      - The quoted “days of consumption” figure reflects a comparable, system-wide inventory measure.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary MOEA reporting for the period shows materially different gas days-of-cover under the same definition.
