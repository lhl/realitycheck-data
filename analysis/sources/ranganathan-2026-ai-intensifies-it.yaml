      HBR managerial framing based on “in-progress” field research (single company; qualitative observation + interviews).
      Strong for describing a plausible mechanism cluster and concrete workplace behaviors; weaker for general prevalence,
      effect sizes, and causal attribution outside the studied context.

      In an eight-month field study (April–December 2025) at a ~200-person U.S.-based technology company,
      the authors report that generative AI adoption was associated with work intensification: employees
      worked at a faster pace, took on a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day,
      often without being asked to do so.

    operationalization: >-
      Replicate with mixed methods: instrumented time-use + comms telemetry + interviews before/after AI rollout;
      measure changes in task scope, after-hours work, and pace proxies.
    assumptions:
      - The reported field methods and accounts accurately reflect typical worker behavior during the study window.
      - The observed patterns are not solely a short-lived novelty effect.
    falsifiers:
      - Comparable replications find decreased pace/scope/hours after AI adoption.
      - Evidence shows intensification in this case was driven mainly by explicit quotas/targets rather than AI-enabled scope creep.

      The authors attribute AI-driven work intensification to three mechanisms: (1) task expansion (workers
      take on responsibilities they previously outsourced or avoided), (2) blurred boundaries between work and
      non-work (micro-work during breaks and off-hours), and (3) more multitasking/parallel threads, which
      increases context switching and cognitive load even when work feels productive.

    operationalization: >-
      Measure changes in (a) task diversity and cross-role work, (b) after-hours work events, and (c) concurrent
      active tasks/context switches (e.g., window/app switching, message checking) alongside fatigue/burnout scales.
    assumptions:
      - Reduced start-friction and rapid feedback causally increase parallelism and boundary-crossing.
    falsifiers:
      - Telemetry shows AI adoption reduces context switching and increases true recovery time without shifting load elsewhere.

      Establishing an organizational “AI practice” (norms and standards around AI use, including intentional
      pauses, sequencing work to reduce fragmentation, and “human grounding” through structured human connection)
      can mitigate AI-driven burnout risk while preserving AI-enabled throughput.

    source_ids: ["ranganathan-2026-ai-intensifies-it"]
    operationalization: >-
      Run field experiments: compare teams adopting explicit pause/sequencing/grounding interventions vs controls,
      measuring burnout, retention, defect rates, and throughput over multiple quarters.
    assumptions:
      - Norms meaningfully change behavior even when incentives favor responsiveness.
    falsifiers:
      - Controlled trials show no measurable burnout reduction (or reduced throughput without well-being gains).
