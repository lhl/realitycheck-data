      Produced by the same group that published AI 2027, with an explicit goal of forecasting fast AI
      timelines and takeoff dynamics. Strengths: unusually explicit operational definitions (AC/SAR/TED-AI/ASI),
      open acknowledgement of parameter uncertainty, and links to an interactive model site. Risks: heavy reliance
      on a small set of trend proxies (notably METR time horizon), substantial subjective parameterization (“intuitive guesses”),
      and anchoring to earlier scenario framing.

      The AI Futures Project’s Dec 2025 update announces a unified timelines-and-takeoff model (AI Futures Model)
      forecasting milestone arrival (e.g., AC, SAR, TED-AI, ASI) and takeoff speeds.

      Verify that the post describes the unified model and the milestone/takeoff forecast framing.
    assumptions:
      - The published post reflects the authors’ intended model description.
    falsifiers:
      - The post does not actually describe a unified model or milestone/takeoff forecasts.

      The AI Futures Project claims their AI Futures Model implies timelines to full coding automation (AC) that are about
      3–5 years longer than their April 2025 AI 2027-era timelines model, partly because they are less bullish on pre-automation
      AI R&D speedups.

      Locate the stated 3–5 year shift claim and its attributed causes in the Dec 2025 update text.
    assumptions:
      - The comparison refers to comparable milestone definitions across model versions.
    falsifiers:
      - The post does not state a 3–5 year shift, or attributes it differently.

    text: >-
      The AI Futures Project claims the 3–5 year median shift to coding automation is primarily due to improved modeling of
      AI R&D automation, and is a larger change than what new empirical evidence caused.

    operationalization: >-
      Locate the attribution statement (modeling vs new evidence) in the Dec 2025 update text.
    assumptions:
      - The post distinguishes 'modeling improvements' from 'new empirical evidence' as causal attributions for forecast shifts.
    falsifiers:
      - The post attributes the forecast shift mainly to new empirical evidence rather than modeling changes.

      The AI Futures Project claims their previous model (median parameters) predicted superhuman coder (SC) medians around
      2027–2028, while their new model predicts around 2032.

    operationalization: >-
      Locate the explicit comparison of SC medians between the old and new models in the post.
    assumptions:
      - The 'SC' milestone is defined consistently in both comparisons.
    falsifiers:
      - The post reports materially different SC medians or no such comparison.

      The AI Futures Project operationalizes the Automated Coder (AC) milestone as a system that can fully automate an AGI
      project’s coding work (replacing the coding staff) using about 5% of the project’s compute supply.

      Locate the AC definition and compute-budget constraint in the milestone-definitions section of the post.
    assumptions:
      - The definition is intended as an operational test, not merely a narrative label.
    falsifiers:
      - The post’s AC definition differs materially from the claim (e.g., no compute constraint, different replacement criterion).

      In the Dec 2025 AI Futures Model update, Eli Lifland reports increasing his all-things-considered probability that
      AC→ASI happens in <1 year from 26% to 30%, and in <3 years from 43% to 60%.

      Locate the passage describing the probability adjustments for AC→ASI takeoff speed.
    assumptions:
      - Percentages refer to the author’s stated all-things-considered distribution at the time of publication.
    falsifiers:
      - The post does not include these probability adjustments or states different values.
