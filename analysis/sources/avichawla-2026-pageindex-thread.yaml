      Social-media summary with strong promotional framing (“SOTA”, “solves this”); low methodological detail.
      Some concrete claims are checkable via linked open-source repos, but generalizations about RAG failure modes
      are largely interpretive.

      In long professional documents, semantic similarity is often an imperfect proxy for retrieval relevance
      (“similarity ≠ relevance”), causing similarity-based RAG to miss key sections.

      Measure retrieval recall/precision for long-document QA tasks under vector similarity retrieval vs
      relevance-grounded judgments, including “appendix/footnote/see Table X” style queries.
    assumptions:
      - The benchmark tasks include structurally-located answers with low lexical/semantic overlap.
    falsifiers:
      - Empirical studies show similarity-based retrieval achieves high recall for structurally-located answers at scale.

      Structure-aware retrieval that reasons over a document hierarchy can improve retrieval for queries whose
      answers are in semantically distant but structurally relevant sections.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare end-to-end QA accuracy and evidence recall for hierarchy-based routing systems versus vector/hybrid
      baselines on long structured-document benchmarks, controlling for model and context budget.
    assumptions:
      - Document structure is extractable and correlated with relevance for the task distribution.
    falsifiers:
      - Controlled comparisons show no meaningful gain from hierarchy-based routing after strong hybrid retrieval/reranking.

      Tree-based reasoning-first retrieval is not universally optimal; vector search remains fast and effective for
      many applications.

    operationalization: >-
      Evaluate cost/latency/quality tradeoffs across representative RAG workloads; identify regimes where
      reasoning-first traversal is dominated by vector/hybrid retrieval.
    assumptions:
      - Typical RAG workloads include many short-doc or high-throughput retrieval scenarios.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows reasoning-first traversal dominates vector/hybrid retrieval on quality and cost across broad workloads.
