      Official PLA Daily commentary on the Zhang Youxia/Liu Zhenli case framed it as involving “political” issues and
      harm to the party’s absolute leadership over the military (not only corruption).

    operationalization: >-
      Quote the PLA Daily editorial text and classify whether it emphasizes political authority, cliques, and the “CMC chairman
      responsibility system” versus purely graft/discipline framing.
    assumptions:
      - The captured Sky News paraphrase matches the PLA Daily editorial text.
    falsifiers:
      - PLA Daily editorial lacks the political framing described.

    text: >-
      Amid information scarcity, rumors circulated that Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli were involved in a coup plot against Xi Jinping,
      but such claims are unsubstantiated in publicly available evidence.

      Track rumor propagation (social platforms, fringe outlets) and check whether any credible corroborating evidence appears
      (leaks, arrests, authoritative reporting).
    assumptions:
      - Sky’s characterization reflects real rumor circulation.
    falsifiers:
      - No meaningful rumor circulation is observable; or credible evidence substantiates an actual coup plot.

      The generals promoted to replace purged commanders may skew younger and more ideologically nationalistic, potentially reducing
      restraint and increasing medium-term Taiwan escalation risk.

    operationalization: >-
      Observe replacement profiles (career tracks, commissar vs operator, public rhetoric), and track subsequent cross-strait coercion
      intensity and crisis behavior after appointments.
    assumptions:
      - Replacement selection meaningfully affects strategic restraint.
    falsifiers:
      - Replacement pattern favors risk-averse commissars/inspectors and cross-strait behavior de-escalates.
