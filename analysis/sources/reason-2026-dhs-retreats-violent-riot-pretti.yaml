      Opinionated framing, but anchored in cross-checkable artifacts (video, quoted statements, and a CBP/OPR-to-Congress writeup
      as reproduced by other outlets). Treat claims about “what the video shows” as provisional unless the primary footage is
      directly reviewed.

      In November 2025, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis found that Gregory Bovino lied about whether he was hit by a rock before
      deploying tear gas at Chicago protesters; video evidence disproved his account and he later admitted he was hit only after.

    assumptions:
      - The judge’s finding is accurately summarized by secondary reporting.
    falsifiers:
      - The court order/video record does not support the claim that Bovino reversed the pre/post-hit sequence.
