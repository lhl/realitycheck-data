      Produced by the AI Futures Project. Strengths: defines a concrete “superhuman coder” milestone; shows multiple
      methods + an all-things-considered forecast; includes parameter ranges and code links. Risks: strong conditional
      assumptions (no catastrophe, no slowdown, no supply-chain disruptions), reliance on sparse proxy trends, and
      post-hoc edits (May/Dec updates) that complicate “what was believed when.”

      The AI 2027 timelines-forecast note states that, under its strong assumptions (no catastrophes/slowdown/supply-chain
      disruptions), its forecasts give a substantial chance of superhuman coding (SC) arriving by and in 2027.

    operationalization: >-
      Define 'substantial chance' as a numeric threshold (e.g., ≥10%) and inspect the note’s stated distributions/wording
      for SC-by-2027 probability mass.
    assumptions:
      - The conditional assumptions are satisfied.
    falsifiers:
      - The note’s distributions/wording do not support ≥10% probability mass on SC by end of 2027.

      The AI 2027 timelines-forecast note defines a superhuman coder (SC) as: using ~5% of compute budget, run ~30× as many
      coding agents as human research engineers, each doing AI-research coding tasks at ~30× the speed of the company’s best
      engineer across any researcher’s area of expertise.

      Locate the SC definition section in the note and confirm the 5% compute / 30× agents / 30× speed elements.
    assumptions:
      - The definition is intended as an operational capability threshold.
    falsifiers:
      - The note’s SC definition differs materially from this description.

      The AI 2027 timelines-forecast note sets a Mar 2025 assumption that the 80% coding time-horizon doubling time is 4.5
      months with an 80% CI of [2.5, 9] months (while noting different recent-period estimates with few data points).

      Locate the 'Time horizon doubling time' parameter in the note and confirm the point estimate and CI.
    assumptions:
      - The parameter is an authors’ modeling assumption, not a direct empirical estimate.

      The AI 2027 timelines-forecast note reports a code bug in interpolating the progress multiplier (missing a −1/+1 transform)
      that overestimated intermediate speedups and shifted the model’s SC median by about 9 months.
