    operationalization: "Verify rc-db claim schema includes evidence_level/credence and relationship fields; confirm CRUD exists in scripts/db.py."
    assumptions:
      - "The README reflects shipped CLI+DB schema rather than purely aspirational features."
    falsifiers:
      - "DB schema or CLI lacks credence/evidence/relationship fields or operations."

    credence: 0.85
    source_ids: ["lhl-2026-realitycheck-readme"]
    operationalization: "Confirm workflow docs/templates and analysis validator expect three stages or an equivalent output contract."
    assumptions:
      - "The methodology is represented in docs/templates, not only implied in README prose."
    falsifiers:
      - "No 3-stage structure exists in methodology docs/templates/validators."

    operationalization: "Confirm evidence_links table exists and rc-db has evidence add/list/get operations."
    assumptions:
      - "Evidence links are first-class records (not only narrative references in Markdown)."
    falsifiers:
      - "No evidence_links table/CLI exists or it lacks location/strength metadata."

    assumptions:
      - "Reasoning trails are stored as structured records in the DB."
    falsifiers:
      - "No reasoning_trails table/CLI exists or it does not store credence justification."

    assumptions:
      - "Prediction tracking is integrated with claim types/statuses rather than a separate, manual process only."
    falsifiers:
      - "No predictions table/CLI exists or predictions cannot be linked to [P] claims."

    assumptions:
      - "Chains are represented as structured objects rather than only prose documents."
    falsifiers:
      - "No chain schema/CLI exists or chains cannot reference claims."

    operationalization: "Confirm rc-db search exists and returns nearest-neighbor results from embedded claim text."
    assumptions:
      - "Embeddings can be generated and stored for claims in the DB."
    falsifiers:
      - "Search command absent or never returns similarity-ranked results even with embeddings present."

  - id: "META-2026-031"
