    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.65
    source_ids: ["google-2026-translategemma-blog"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify Vistra benchmark results comparing TranslateGemma to baseline Gemma 3 and confirm translation quality
      is retained/improved for image text.
    assumptions:
      - Vistra is representative of image-text translation use cases.
    falsifiers:
      - Reported Vistra results show degraded multimodal translation vs baseline.
