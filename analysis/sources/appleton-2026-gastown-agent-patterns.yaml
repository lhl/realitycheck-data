      Reflective practitioner essay grounded in a close reading of Yegge’s “Gas Town” artifacts and surrounding
      discourse. Strong on concrete workflow pattern extraction; weaker on quantified impact claims (costs, ROI,
      timeline predictions), which are partly conjectural and anchored to early-2026 pricing dynamics.

      At high scale, agentic coding shifts the binding constraint from implementation time to human design,
      planning, and decision-making (product strategy, architecture, UX taste).

    source_ids: ["appleton-2026-gastown-agent-patterns"]
    operationalization: >-
      Measure time and queueing delays across agent-heavy teams (spec/design, implementation, review, merge,
      incident/rework) and test whether design/planning becomes the dominant critical-path constraint as the
      number of concurrent agents increases.
    assumptions:
      - Agentic systems substantially reduce implementation time for a large share of tasks.
      - Design decisions cannot be reliably delegated to agents without unacceptable error.
    falsifiers:
      - Empirical studies show review/verification or compliance remains the dominant bottleneck even under high agent throughput.

      Successful multi-agent orchestrators will tend to adopt specialized agent roles with hierarchical
      supervision (a primary coordinator interface plus worker agents and supervisor agents) to reduce
      cognitive overhead and coordination failures.

    source_ids: ["appleton-2026-gastown-agent-patterns"]
    operationalization: >-
      Survey/benchmark orchestrator systems over 2026–2027 for convergence on role hierarchies (coordinator,
      workers, supervisors) and compare coordination error rates vs flat-agent architectures.
    assumptions:
      - Coordination and attention management are limiting factors in multi-agent workflows.
    falsifiers:
      - Flat, non-hierarchical agent pools achieve comparable reliability and overhead at similar scale.

      Persisting task and identity state outside the model context (e.g., structured git-backed work items)
      enables disposable agent sessions and mitigates context-window and “context rot” limitations.

    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.70
    source_ids: ["appleton-2026-gastown-agent-patterns"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare long-running task success rates between agents that rely primarily on in-context conversation
      history versus agents that externalize plans/tasks/state into structured artifacts (task ledgers,
      queues, memory stores) with periodic session reset.
    assumptions:
      - Session resets reduce degradation from long-context drift.
      - External state can be kept consistent and cheap to read/write.
    falsifiers:
      - Externalized task/state adds overhead and does not improve end-to-end reliability in controlled comparisons.

      High-parallelism agentic development requires explicit integration tooling (merge queues, conflict
      resolution agents, or stacked-diff workflows) to keep changes small, reviewable, and compatible.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["appleton-2026-gastown-agent-patterns"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track merge-conflict rate, integration cycle time, and rework/rollback incidence as teams increase
      parallel agent throughput; test whether merge queues/stacked diffs reduce these costs relative to
      traditional PR workflows.
    assumptions:
      - Agentic throughput materially increases the number of concurrent in-flight changes.
    falsifiers:
      - Traditional PR workflows sustain similar throughput without increased integration costs under high parallelism.

      Organizations may rationally pay on the order of $1k–$3k/month for a robust agent orchestrator if it
      yields ~2–3× productivity on senior developers; willingness-to-pay scales with local developer salaries.

    operationalization: >-
      Estimate ROI by measuring marginal output and defect/rework costs before/after orchestrator adoption;
      compare observed spend levels and retention across salary bands and regions.
    assumptions:
      - Productivity gains persist after accounting for review, defects, and coordination overhead.
    falsifiers:
      - Market prices and observed willingness-to-pay remain close to commodity assistant tiers despite strong measured ROI.

    text: >-
      “Code distance” (how directly humans can view/edit code versus directing agents) is a central UI and
      workflow design axis for agentic development tools; the optimal distance depends on domain/language,
      feedback loops, risk tolerance, and team coordination.

    source_ids: ["appleton-2026-gastown-agent-patterns"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare outcomes (latency, defect rates, operator satisfaction, auditability) across tools that are
      code-first (IDE-centric) versus agent-first (chat/CLI-centric), stratified by domain risk and feedback-loop strength.
    assumptions:
      - Different domains have materially different audit and risk constraints.
    falsifiers:
      - One interaction paradigm dominates across domains when measured on comparable outcome metrics.

      Over the next 1–2 years, improved harnesses (tests, validation loops, and specialized QA/security
      agents) will enable broader “code-at-a-distance” workflows where humans inspect less code directly.

    source_ids: ["appleton-2026-gastown-agent-patterns"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track adoption of agentic tooling features (automated tests, provenance/attestation, security scanning,
      policy gates) and correlate with reduced manual diff inspection and stable or improved defect/incident metrics.
    assumptions:
      - Guardrails can catch a large fraction of high-severity errors before merge.
    falsifiers:
      - Teams retain high levels of manual inspection due to debugging, accountability, and audit requirements despite improved harnesses.
