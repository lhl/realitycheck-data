      Analytical framing (elite politics + Taiwan risk) relying heavily on expert interpretation. Treat motive claims,
      leak plausibility, and succession implications as hypotheses rather than confirmed facts.

      The public announcement of an investigation into Zhang Youxia was unusually fast, occurring within days of
      his apparent absence from a party meeting, compared with months of delay between disappearance and confirmation
      in prior senior-figure cases.

    operationalization: >-
      Create a timeline dataset for recent purges: last public appearance, first rumor spike, first official confirmation;
      compare lag distributions across cases.
    assumptions:
      - The capture accurately reflects Bloomberg’s timeline comparison.
    falsifiers:
      - Documented timelines show the lag was typical relative to comparable cases.

    text: >-
      Analysts cited by Bloomberg argue the allegation that Zhang Youxia leaked nuclear weapons information is implausible
      given tight monitoring of senior generals and limited official contact channels with U.S. counterparts.

    operationalization: >-
      Evaluate whether Zhang plausibly had access pathways to “core technical data” and opportunities to transmit it (travel,
      meetings, communication channels), and whether comparable leaks at that rank have occurred historically.
    assumptions:
      - Monitoring and compartmentalization constraints meaningfully limit such leakage.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible evidence shows feasible access/transmission paths and corroboration of the leak allegation.

      As a Politburo member and the most powerful uniformed general, Zhang Youxia had unusual political clout and (in theory)
      could have helped mobilize opposition to Xi Jinping’s succession plans ahead of the 2027 leadership reshuffle.

    operationalization: >-
      Map Zhang’s network (protégés, unit overlaps, patronage ties) and look for evidence of independent organizing capacity;
      compare with historical cases where the PLA defied party leaders.
    assumptions:
      - Politburo membership and network ties translate to real organizing capacity in the PLA.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence indicates Zhang’s network was shallow or already dismantled, with no plausible succession leverage.

      Bloomberg frames U.S. political volatility under President Trump and allied disputes as part of the context driving
      speculation about whether Xi Jinping might see opportunity (or face constraints) in Taiwan strategy.

    operationalization: >-
      Track PRC Taiwan coercion metrics against major U.S. alliance shocks and U.S. public posture changes to estimate
      whether such volatility measurably shifts PRC behavior.
    assumptions:
      - PRC Taiwan planning is sensitive to perceived U.S. resolve and alliance cohesion.
    falsifiers:
      - PRC behavior shows no correlation with U.S. alliance volatility, controlling for other factors.

      The near-eradication of the PLA’s top leadership and resulting vacancy/infighting may make Xi Jinping more cautious about
      using major military force against Taiwan in the near term.

    operationalization: >-
      Track near-term invasion indicators (mobilization, logistics, joint-force exercises) and compare to baseline; also track
      gray-zone coercion levels to see if risk shifts rather than falls.
    assumptions:
      - Leadership vacancies materially constrain major joint operations planning/execution.
    falsifiers:
      - Near-term invasion indicators increase despite the leadership vacuum.
