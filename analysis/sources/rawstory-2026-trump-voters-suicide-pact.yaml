      Secondary write-up of an opinion Substack post (Rick Wilson); strong anti-Trump framing; several quantitative

      In the USDA ERS 2015 County Typology Codes (industry dependence), 444 U.S. counties are classified as
      “Farming” (often referred to as “farming-dependent” counties).
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "SOC"

    operationalization: >-
      Download the USDA ERS “County Typology Codes, 2015 Edition” CSV and count rows where Economic_Type_Label
      equals “Farming”.
    assumptions:
      - The ERS “Farming” industry-dependence label corresponds to Wilson’s “farming-dependent counties” phrasing.
    falsifiers:
      - ERS data show a materially different count under the same definition.

      In the 2024 presidential election, Trump received nearly 78% of the vote in the 444 farming-dependent counties.

    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.30
    source_ids: ["rawstory-2026-trump-voters-suicide-pact"]
    operationalization: >-
      Join the ERS list of “Farming” counties to county-level 2024 presidential election results and compute Trump’s
      vote share (define whether this is total-vote share or two-party share).
    assumptions:
      - County FIPS codes align between the ERS typology dataset and the election dataset.
      - “78%” refers to a consistently defined vote-share measure.
    falsifiers:
      - Recomputed vote share differs materially from ~78% under reasonable definitions.

      China has accounted for roughly half of U.S. soybean exports in at least some recent years.

    credence: 0.75
    source_ids: ["rawstory-2026-trump-voters-suicide-pact"]
    operationalization: >-
      Use USDA FAS GATS export volumes by destination and compute China’s share of total U.S. soybean exports
      for the referenced year(s).
    assumptions:
      - “Share” refers to export volume (e.g., metric tons) in a specified marketing/calendar year.
    falsifiers:
      - USDA destination-share data show China’s share is far from ~50% in the relevant period.

      By 2026, China stopped buying U.S. soybeans entirely (effectively zero U.S. soybean exports to China).

    credence: 0.15
    source_ids: ["rawstory-2026-trump-voters-suicide-pact"]
    operationalization: >-
      Check USDA FAS export-by-destination data for the relevant months/years and verify whether U.S. soybean exports
      to China were effectively zero for an extended period.
    assumptions:
      - “Walked away entirely” corresponds to approximately zero exports over a meaningful time window, not a brief dip.
    falsifiers:
      - USDA data show non-zero exports to China during the claimed “entirely” period.

      Net farm income is projected to decline by about $41 billion in 2026 (about a 23% drop) relative to the prior year.

      Identify the underlying forecast source (USDA ERS or another forecaster) and compare year-over-year net farm
      income changes for the referenced years using consistent (nominal or inflation-adjusted) dollars.
    assumptions:
      - The claim refers to USDA’s “net farm income” concept (not net cash farm income or another measure).
      - The baseline year and inflation adjustment are consistent with the cited forecast.
    falsifiers:
      - Authoritative forecast series shows a materially different change in net farm income for 2026.

      By 2026, average per-acre margins are approximately -$169 for corn, -$114 for soybeans, and about -$400 for cotton.

      Locate the budget model or dataset used (state extension budgets, USDA cost-of-production, or a cited report),
      determine whether figures are net returns over variable or total costs, and reproduce the per-acre estimates.
    assumptions:
      - The figures are meant as representative averages, not a worst-case scenario for a specific region.
    falsifiers:
      - Reproduced budgets show materially different per-acre margins under comparable assumptions.

      Roughly 70% of U.S. crop farmworkers are foreign-born.

      Use DOL’s National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) or ACS tabulations (as summarized by USDA ERS) to estimate
      the U.S.-born vs foreign-born share of crop farmworkers in the relevant years.
    assumptions:
      - The statistic is referring to crop farmworkers (not all agricultural workers including livestock).
    falsifiers:
      - Official survey-based estimates show a substantially different foreign-born share.

      One grower lost about $5 million because crops could not be harvested due to farm-labor shortages linked to
      immigration enforcement.

      Locate the original reporting or documentation for the case, verify the $5M figure, and confirm the causal link
      to enforcement-driven labor shortages versus other drivers (weather, disease, logistics).
    assumptions:
      - The reported loss figure is measured consistently (revenue vs profit) and is attributable primarily to labor shortages.
    falsifiers:
      - No reliable source substantiates the $5M figure or attributes it to immigration-enforcement-related labor loss.

      Farm distress driven by tariffs and immigration policy will be a major political liability for Republicans in the
      2026 midterm elections.

      Track polling/issue salience and election outcomes in farming-dependent counties versus other counties, and test
      whether measured farm distress predicts GOP underperformance relative to baseline.
    assumptions:
      - Voters update partisan preferences based on perceived economic performance and attribute it to incumbents.
    falsifiers:
      - GOP performance does not decline in farming-dependent counties despite sustained measured distress.
