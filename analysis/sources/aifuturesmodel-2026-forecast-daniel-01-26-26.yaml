      Primary source for the authors’ published “all-things-considered” forecast distributions at a given snapshot.
      Risks: interactive UI + dynamic charting makes capture fragile; values may change over time; and ATC is explicitly
      subjective adjustment. Treat as a disclosure artifact, not independent evidence about the world.
