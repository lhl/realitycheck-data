      Highly compressed, adversarial framing; mixes legal-technical assertions with worst-case rhetorical
      extrapolation. Some items are checkable against statutes/regulations and reported internal DHS/ICE memos;
      others are broad generalizations.

      ICE has asserted authority to forcibly enter homes to make immigration arrests without a judge-signed
      warrant (e.g., relying on an administrative warrant).
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.90
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Obtain the primary memo/policy text and any court rulings; determine whether ICE authorizes forced entry
      into residences based on administrative warrants and under what constraints.
    assumptions:
      - Reported descriptions of the memo accurately reflect the policy.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary-source memo/policy shows no authorization for forced entry without judicial warrant.
      - Credible reporting confirms the memo was forged, withdrawn, or materially mischaracterized.

      Federal law requires noncitizens (18+) to carry their registration documents (e.g., alien registration or
      receipt card) at all times.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E2"
    credence: 0.95
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify statutory text and any controlling judicial interpretations of 8 U.S.C. § 1304(e), including
      applicability, enforcement practices, and penalties.
    assumptions:
      - “Alien” is interpreted as “noncitizen” under the INA definition.
    falsifiers:
      - Statutory amendment repeals or narrows the “at all times carry” requirement.

      In some encounters, ICE agents may disregard paper documents and instead rely primarily on biometric
      identity checks (fingerprint/face ID) to determine identity/status.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Review ICE/ERO field procedures and after-action reports; measure how often documentary proof is accepted
      on scene versus biometric/database confirmation being treated as authoritative.
    assumptions:
      - Field operations commonly have access to biometric tools and databases.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows ICE reliably accepts documentary proof as sufficient and does not treat biometrics as the
        primary determinant in comparable encounters.

      ICE can detain people broadly across contexts, including children, and errors can result in detention of
      U.S. citizens.

    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.65
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Measure detention incidence by age and status during comparable enforcement surges; quantify rates of
      citizen misidentification and the conditions that produced it.
    assumptions:
      - Enforcement surges increase error rates and collateral detentions.
    falsifiers:
      - High-quality data show child detention and citizen misidentification are extremely rare in comparable operations.

      ICE can detain people indefinitely with no access to a lawyer.
    type: "[H]"

    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.20
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Review statutory/regulatory rights to counsel and detention time limits; measure access-to-counsel latency
      and length-of-detention distributions across categories (pre- and post-removal order).
    assumptions:
      - “No access” refers to practical barriers rather than absence of a legal privilege.
    falsifiers:
      - Binding law provides government-appointed counsel and authorizes indefinite detention without meaningful review.

  - id: "GOV-2026-038"
    text: >-
      People targeted by ICE generally have no meaningful right to a day in court.
    type: "[H]"

    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare proportions of removals conducted via immigration court hearings vs expedited/summary processes;
      assess scope of judicial review and habeas availability by category.
    assumptions:
      - Expedited removal and limited-review pathways are widely used in the relevant context.
    falsifiers:
      - Data show most removals involve meaningful adversarial hearings with robust review.

      ICE can deport some people to third countries (not their country of origin), potentially on short notice and
      with limited procedural safeguards.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.70
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Obtain primary memo/court filings describing third-country removal procedures; track notice times,
      opportunities to contest, and use of diplomatic assurances.
    assumptions:
      - Reported memo guidance is accurate and operationalized.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary-source guidance or court rulings show substantial notice/procedural safeguards are required and applied.

      If ICE makes a serious mistake (e.g., wrongful removal), it generally cannot or will not bring the person back.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.40
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Review ICE return-facilitation policy scope; measure frequency and speed of returns after wrongful removal or
      successful litigation, including cases without Supreme Court/circuit court wins.
    assumptions:
      - The “mistake” scenario includes wrongful removals and mistaken detentions leading to removal.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows ICE routinely facilitates return in mistake cases beyond narrow policy categories.

    text: >-
      If someone interferes with ICE activity, ICE can use lethal force and justify it by labeling the person a terrorist.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.15
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare ICE/CBP use-of-force policies to incidents; test whether “terrorism” labeling is used as a legal
      justification for lethal force absent imminent threat.
    assumptions:
      - The claim asserts policy-like permission rather than isolated misconduct.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary policies and incident investigations show lethal force is constrained to imminent-threat situations and
        “terrorism” labeling does not substitute for legal justification.

  - id: "GOV-2026-042"
    text: >-
      DHS/ICE leadership and allied messaging have repeatedly labeled people involved in immigration-enforcement
      incidents and interference/observation as “domestic terrorists”/“terrorists,” often immediately after events.
    type: "[F]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.75
    source_ids: ["bluebadger2600-2026-ice-positions"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compile official DHS/ICE statements and reported quotes over time; measure how often “domestic terrorism”
      framing is applied immediately after use-of-force incidents and toward filming/observation/obstruction activity.
    assumptions:
      - Reporting accurately quotes officials and DHS/ICE messaging.
    falsifiers:
      - A systematic review of statements shows “domestic terrorism” framing is rare and not used in comparable incidents.
