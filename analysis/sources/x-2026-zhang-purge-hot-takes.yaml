claims:
  - id: "GEO-2026-019"
    text: >-
      Some commentators predict Taiwan will not be invaded any time soon and claim the purge pushes any invasion timeline into the 2030s.

    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.20
    source_ids: ["x-2026-zhang-purge-hot-takes"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track invasion indicators and the occurrence/non-occurrence of a major attack through 2030; refine prediction into a dated
      probability distribution.
    assumptions:
      - Publicly observable indicators can meaningfully estimate invasion likelihood.
    falsifiers:
      - A major invasion attempt occurs before 2030.

  - id: "GOV-2026-064"
    text: >-
      Some commentators claim the U.S. deliberately exposed (“burned”) intelligence assets to derail Chinese invasion plans and force
      China to waste time on internal investigations.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.10
    source_ids: ["x-2026-zhang-purge-hot-takes"]
    operationalization: >-
      Look for credible evidence of a specific intelligence operation, asset exposures, and a causal chain linking exposure to the purge.
    assumptions:
      - Such operations would leave observable traces or later credible disclosures.
    falsifiers:
      - No credible evidence of such an operation emerges and alternative explanations fit better.

  - id: "GOV-2026-065"
    text: >-
      Some commentators hypothesize that “treason/spying” allegations were seeded as information warfare to pressure Zhang Youxia’s allies
      or shape internal outcomes, rather than reflecting true internal findings.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.20
    source_ids: ["x-2026-zhang-purge-hot-takes"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track whether the allegation appears only in foreign media with weak sourcing versus later internal/official narratives; look for signs
      of coordinated narrative seeding.
    assumptions:
      - Disinformation patterns are detectable via cross-outlet timing and content analysis.
    falsifiers:
      - Multiple independent corroborations substantiate real internal findings consistent with the allegations.

  - id: "GOV-2026-066"
    text: >-
      Some commentators argue the “nuclear secrets” allegation is implausible given compartmentalization and monitoring at Zhang’s rank,
      and that procurement corruption is a simpler and more likely explanation for the purge.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.35
    source_ids: ["x-2026-zhang-purge-hot-takes"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare evidentiary support for the nuclear-leak allegation versus procurement-corruption narratives across outlets; examine whether
      later disclosures emphasize procurement.
    assumptions:
      - Compartmentalization and monitoring constraints significantly limit nuclear-technical leaks.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible evidence corroborates a genuine nuclear-technical leak by Zhang.

    text: >-
      Some social-media posts claim a coup is taking place in China and that top military generals are being executed.
    type: "[S]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.05
    source_ids: ["x-2026-zhang-purge-hot-takes"]
    operationalization: >-
      Seek credible corroboration (multiple major outlets, primary evidence, confirmed arrests/executions) and timeline consistency.
    assumptions:
      - A real coup/execution wave would produce credible external signals.
    falsifiers:
      - No credible corroboration appears and PRC leadership stability indicators remain normal.

  - id: "INST-2026-032"
    text: >-
      Some commentators claim Xi’s purge has hollowed out PLA command structures such that 2026 is the PLA’s weakest year, making a near-term
      Taiwan war less likely.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "INST"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.25
    source_ids: ["x-2026-zhang-purge-hot-takes"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track appointment stability, training tempo, and observable operational readiness indicators across 2026 relative to prior years.
    assumptions:
      - Public indicators capture meaningful components of readiness and command cohesion.
    falsifiers:
      - Indicators show stable/increasing readiness and command functioning in 2026.

  - id: "GEO-2026-020"
    text: >-
      Some commentators predict the purge makes the Taiwan Strait safer in the near term by reducing the probability of a major PLA attack.
    type: "[P]"
    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.30
    source_ids: ["x-2026-zhang-purge-hot-takes"]
    operationalization: >-
      Define “safer” with measurable indicators (invasion probability, gray-zone incidents, accidents) and track changes over 2026.
    assumptions:
      - “Safety” can be operationalized as a combination of measurable risk indicators.
    falsifiers:
      - Gray-zone coercion or crisis incidents increase even if invasion probability is perceived to drop.
