      Edited transcript of an NYT Opinion podcast; high-quality interlocutors but incentives toward vivid framing and strong
      interpretive claims. Several factual assertions (trade shares, tariffs, cabinet roles) require external verification.

      The 'rupture' in the international order is substantially a cultural shift toward overt coercion (threats, bullying,
      violence) as normal great-power behavior, not just a gradual multipolar transition.
    type: "[T]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]
    operationalization: >-
      Operationalize 'overt coercion' via datasets of coercive threats, sanctions, territorial threats, and explicit ultimata;
      test for level shifts vs trend continuity across 2010–2026.
    assumptions:
      - Observable coercion proxies track the underlying norm shift (not just media coverage).
    falsifiers:
      - Coercion indicators remain flat or decline, and restraint norms dominate comparable crisis episodes.

      In January 2026, President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on multiple European countries in connection with U.S. efforts
      to secure control/purchase of Greenland.

      instruments were issued and implemented.
    assumptions:
      - Reporting accurately reflects the President's statement and its Greenland linkage.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary-source record contradicts the tariff threat or its Greenland linkage.

      In an August 2019 Jackson Hole speech, Mark Carney argued that dollar dominance in the international monetary/financial
      system creates instability and discussed the possibility of a "Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC)".

    evidence_level: "E2"
    credence: 0.95
    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify directly from the published speech text/PDF and confirm the SHC discussion is present and accurately characterized.

      We should not assume the current breakdown implies a successor stable global order; instead, we should expect many partial
      "ordering attempts" without guaranteed convergence to a coherent new order.
    type: "[T]"
    domain: "GOV"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.50
    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]
    operationalization: >-
      Define observable proxies for order (institutional compliance, dispute resolution, alliance cohesion) and test whether they
      converge to a new steady state over 2026–2036.
    assumptions:
      - Order proxies are measurable and comparable across periods.
    falsifiers:
      - Rapid, broad convergence to a stable successor order is observed.

      China's green-industrial capacity (especially solar modules and battery supply chains) is large enough that leveraging it could
      materially accelerate global decarbonization, making China "central" to plausible climate-stabilization pathways.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "RESOURCE"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.45
    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare scenarios: (a) constrained China imports vs (b) high China utilization, using integrated assessment / energy system
      models to estimate emissions pathways and deployment rates.
    assumptions:
      - China capacity can be deployed globally without binding political/security constraints.
    falsifiers:
      - Non-China capacity scales fast enough at comparable costs, or China capacity is not practically deployable.

      China accounts for the vast majority of EU solar panel imports (order-of-magnitude ~90%+ share).

      Verify with Eurostat import statistics by product category and origin country for 2023–2024.
    assumptions:
      - The EU solar panel import category matches the intended product definition.
    falsifiers:
      - Official EU import statistics show a materially lower China share.

      U.S. direct imports of solar panels from China are near-zero by value (well under 1% share), using HS6 854143 as a proxy
      category for photovoltaic modules/panels.

    domain: "ECON"
    evidence_level: "E2"
    credence: 0.85
    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compute China share from U.S. Census Bureau import data for HS6 854143 for full-year 2023–2024.
    assumptions:
      - HS6 854143 is a reasonable proxy for "solar panels" in the claim context.
    falsifiers:
      - Trade data show a substantial direct China share of US solar panel imports.

      The Oct 7, 2022 U.S. export-control regime targeted advanced computing/AI chips and semiconductor manufacturing items in
      order to constrain PRC military modernization.

    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]

      Verify against the BIS rules and contemporaneous official explanations of scope/intent; map controlled items to AI and
      semiconductor manufacturing categories.
    assumptions:
      - Public summaries accurately reflect the underlying rule intent and scope.
    falsifiers:
      - Primary documents show materially different scope/intent (e.g., no focus on advanced computing/AI).

      The "axis of democracies vs authoritarians" framing is analytically unhelpful because China–Russia alignment is better
      explained as pragmatic/regime-security driven than identity-based ideological alignment.
    type: "[T]"
    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]
    operationalization: >-
      Test competing explanations using elite statements, policy coordination patterns, and divergence episodes; evaluate whether
      ideology predicts behavior better than regime-security pragmatics.
    assumptions:
      - Elite statements and behavior can differentiate ideology vs regime-security motives.
    falsifiers:
      - Ideological affinity reliably predicts alignment behaviors better than pragmatic/regime-security explanations.

      Some high-level Chinese elites hold conspiratorial views that the U.S. orchestrated the Ukraine war to bind Europe more
      closely to Washington.

      Assess via elite discourse analysis, think-tank outputs, and internal/translated statements attributable to senior PRC policy
      circles.
    assumptions:
      - Public/attributable discourse is representative of elite beliefs.
    falsifiers:
      - Elite discourse consistently rejects the conspiratorial framing and attributes primary agency elsewhere.

      Framing the era as a deterministic transition from American order to Chinese hegemony increases the probability of hawkish U.S.
      policies and great-power confrontation.
    type: "[H]"
    domain: "GEO"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["nyt-2026-world-sees-america-tooze"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track framing prevalence in elite discourse and correlate with policy choices (sanctions, export controls, military posture),
      controlling for objective rivalry indicators.
    assumptions:
      - Framing can be measured and plausibly treated as an input to policy coalitions, not only an output.
    falsifiers:
      - Hawkish policy intensifies when hegemony-transition framing declines, or framing changes have no association with policy shifts.
