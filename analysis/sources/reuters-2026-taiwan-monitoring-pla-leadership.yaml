      but does not adjudicate PRC motives or the true military implications of the leadership shakeup.

      Compare Reuters paraphrase to Taiwan MoD/minister press conference transcripts or official social-media
      accounts for wording and emphasis.

      - Reuters accurately paraphrased the minister’s statement.
    falsifiers:
      - Official transcript contradicts the “abnormal changes” framing.

      Track Taiwan MoD alert posture announcements and readiness messaging in the weeks after the purge to
      see whether posture is relaxed or maintained.

      - “Around Taiwan” in reporting maps to a consistent operational definition.
    falsifiers:
      - Daily releases show sustained multi-week gaps without qualifying activity under the chosen definition.
