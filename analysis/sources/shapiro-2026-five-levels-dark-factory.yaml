      Practitioner essay proposing a taxonomy; evidence is primarily personal observation (“dozens of companies”)
      with few measurable definitions. Useful as a shared language for workflow evolution, but empirical
      distribution claims (e.g., “most people top out at level 3”) are not substantiated.

      A useful maturity model for AI coding is a five-level automation taxonomy (0–5), analogous to the widely
      used 0–5 “driving automation” levels, providing teams a shared language for current practice and direction.

      Validate whether the taxonomy predicts key outcomes (cycle time, defects, auditability, org structure)
      better than alternative frameworks across a sample of organizations.
    assumptions:
      - A single dominant dimension (“automation level”) is meaningful across teams and domains.
    falsifiers:
      - Alternative taxonomies fit observed practice better and predict outcomes more accurately.

      In Shapiro’s observation of “dozens of companies,” almost everyone tops out at “Level 3,” where the human
      is primarily a reviewer/manager of AI-generated code (life is diffs).

    operationalization: >-
      Survey organizations using coding agents and measure the share of engineering time spent in code review
      versus spec/harness work; classify workflows and estimate distribution by industry and domain risk.
    assumptions:
      - “Level 3” can be operationalized by time allocation and autonomy windows.
    falsifiers:
      - Empirical distributions show substantial populations at Level 4/5 or, conversely, mostly at Levels 0–2.

      As AI coding automation increases, the human role shifts from coder to code-review manager and then toward
      PM/spec author who checks tests after long autonomous runs.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare role/task distributions (coding, review, spec writing, harness building, incident response) across
      teams at different autonomy levels and track changes over time.
    assumptions:
      - Long autonomous runs are feasible for a meaningful share of work.
    falsifiers:
      - Human time remains primarily coding/review even as autonomy windows increase.

      “Level 5: Dark Factory” can be characterized as a black-box process that turns specs into running software
      with minimal or no routine human code interaction (writing or review).

    operationalization: >-
      Identify organizations claiming “dark factory” workflows and measure the frequency of human code edits,
      diff reviews, and manual debugging relative to releases and incidents.
    assumptions:
      - Code interaction can be instrumented and compared across teams.
    falsifiers:
      - “Dark factory” organizations still require routine human code reading/writing for sustained operation.

      Under “technical deflation” (rapidly cheaper AI coding labor), it can be rational for teams to defer some
      tech-debt repayment in human hours now with the expectation of repaying it later using cheaper AI hours.

    source_ids: ["shapiro-2026-five-levels-dark-factory"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track cohorts of projects that deliberately defer debt vs repay immediately; measure total cost of delay,
      defect/incident rates, and eventual AI-assisted remediation effort, controlling for project type and domain.
    assumptions:
      - AI labor cost declines faster than debt compounding costs for at least some debt types.
    falsifiers:
      - Deferred debt consistently costs more (incidents, delays) than it saves in later AI-assisted remediation.
