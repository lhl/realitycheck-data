      Social-media macro/market take with strong rhetoric (“dead money”), motive attribution, and investment
      positioning. Offers hypotheses about value capture and constraints but provides no empirical evidence.
      Useful as a counterpoint to frontier-lab profitability narratives, not as evidence about financial outcomes.

      Frontier-lab leaders pursue ASI as an existential mission rather than as a profit-maximizing project, and the
      profitability narratives they tell are instrumental stories used to raise capital.

    operationalization: >-
      Evaluate revealed preferences (capital allocation, pricing, governance choices) and (where accessible) internal
      communications for whether profit-maximization dominates leadership objectives over time.
    assumptions:
      - Motives can be inferred from observable decisions and disclosures.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows sustained profit-maximizing behavior dominates strategic choices across leadership and time.

      Frontier labs will not make material profits from “birthing AGI”; investments in foundation labs, hyperscalers,
      semiconductors, and datacenters are effectively “dead money,” despite enormous consumer surplus.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare long-run profit margins and risk-adjusted returns for frontier labs and compute infrastructure providers
      against market benchmarks over the AGI transition period.
    assumptions:
      - “Material profits” can be operationalized via margins and risk-adjusted returns.
    falsifiers:
      - Frontier labs and/or compute providers exhibit sustained material profits and attractive risk-adjusted returns.

      Physical constraints, timing uncertainty, and deployment frictions will limit AI progress to a “manageable”
      (though profoundly disruptive) pace.

    operationalization: >-
      Identify binding constraints (power, chips, data, integration, experimentation) and test whether these impose
      minimum latencies on major capability and deployment milestones.
    assumptions:
      - Progress is rate-limited by physical and organizational constraints even under rapid capability gains.
    falsifiers:
      - Major capability and deployment milestones occur near-instantly once cognitive capability thresholds are crossed.

      Electrification and metals are critical-path inputs with durable bottlenecks, making them more resilient and
      productive ways to capture profits from the hyperscaler/AI sprint than investing in frontier labs.

    operationalization: >-
      Track capex buildout requirements for AI datacenters (power generation, transmission, cooling, metals) and
      measure whether these inputs experience sustained scarcity rents relative to software/model layer profits.
    assumptions:
      - Bottlenecks translate into investable scarcity rents rather than regulated or competed-away returns.
    falsifiers:
      - Scarcity rents do not appear in electrification/metals, or profits concentrate elsewhere.
