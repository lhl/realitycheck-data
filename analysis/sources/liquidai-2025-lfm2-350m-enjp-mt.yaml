      First-party model card. High reliability for intended use, base model lineage, and usage instructions; higher
      bias risk for performance/quality claims without third-party evaluation artifacts.

      LiquidAI/LFM2-350M-ENJP-MT is a checkpoint based on LiquidAI/LFM2-350M that has been fine-tuned for near
      real-time bidirectional Japanese/English translation of short-to-medium inputs.

    evidence_level: "E4"
    credence: 0.85
    source_ids: ["liquidai-2025-lfm2-350m-enjp-mt"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify the stated base model and translation fine-tuning objective in the model card metadata and documentation.
    assumptions:
      - The model card accurately reflects training lineage and intended use.
    falsifiers:
      - The model card indicates a different base model or does not claim bidirectional translation fine-tuning.

    text: >-
      The LFM2-350M-ENJP-MT checkpoint is intended for near real-time / edge translation scenarios where efficiency
      and low latency matter.
    type: "[A]"
    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["liquidai-2025-lfm2-350m-enjp-mt"]
    operationalization: >-
      Benchmark latency/throughput across target hardware and runtimes (CPU/GPU/mobile) at typical sequence lengths
      and confirm it meets “near real-time” requirements for intended applications.
    assumptions:
      - “Near real-time” is defined by a concrete latency budget for the target product context.
    falsifiers:
      - Measured latency does not meet common real-time thresholds under realistic conditions.

    text: >-
      The model card describes the checkpoint as supporting bidirectional translation (EN→JA and JA→EN).

    credence: 0.85
    source_ids: ["liquidai-2025-lfm2-350m-enjp-mt"]
    operationalization: >-
      Verify bidirectionality claims in the model card and test sample prompts for each direction.
    assumptions:
      - Bidirectionality implies the model was trained/evaluated for both directions.
    falsifiers:
      - Documentation or tests indicate the checkpoint is effectively one-directional.

    text: >-
      The model card provides concrete usage instructions (inference examples and guidance) sufficient to reproduce
      baseline model behavior.

    evidence_level: "E2"
    credence: 0.95
    source_ids: ["liquidai-2025-lfm2-350m-enjp-mt"]
    operationalization: >-
      Attempt to run inference using only the model card instructions and confirm a reproducible translation output pipeline.
    assumptions:
      - The code snippets and dependencies referenced remain available.
    falsifiers:
      - Instructions are incomplete or non-functional without additional undocumented steps.
