      Primary court filing containing a single-witness declaration. Strong evidence of what was asserted under
      oath; underlying incident details should be corroborated with bodycam, EMS, and autopsy records. The
      declaration uses “ICE agents” language; agency attribution should be treated as uncertain unless
      corroborated by primary records.

      In a declaration filed in D. Minn. case 0:25-cv-04669-KMM-DTS (Doc. 109, 2026-01-24), an unnamed physician
      states that agents near Alex Pretti after he was shot were not checking for a pulse or performing CPR and
      appeared to be counting bullet wounds; when asked if Pretti had a pulse, the agents said they did not know.

      Corroborate or refute the declared sequence using bodycam/bystander video, EMS run sheets, dispatch
      timeline, and court deposition testimony.
    assumptions:
      - The CourtListener PDF is an authentic copy of the filed declaration.
    falsifiers:
      - Court docket shows the declaration text materially differs or was withdrawn/corrected.
      - Primary records (bodycam/EMS) contradict the described medical-response sequence.

      In the same declaration (D. Minn. 0:25-cv-04669-KMM-DTS, Doc. 109), the physician states that Alex Pretti had
      at least three bullet wounds in his back plus an additional wound on his upper-left chest and a possible
      wound on his neck; the physician reports finding no pulse, beginning CPR, and that EMS arrived and took
      over.
