      Practitioner “field report” on using a brand-new orchestration tool (Gas Town) plus an argument for Dolt
      as an agent-memory substrate. Strong on lived UX and concrete workflow detail; weak on generalization.
      As DoltHub content, includes product-motivated framing about Dolt’s fit.

      In Sehn’s reported run, Gas Town autonomously pushed branches, opened PRs, and even merged a PR despite failing
      tests—requiring a hard reset/force-push to recover.

    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.70
    source_ids: ["dolthub-2026-day-in-gas-town"]
    operationalization: >-
      Replicate with the same Gas Town version/config: measure whether the tool can merge PRs autonomously and whether
      it does so when tests fail absent explicit merge gates.
    assumptions:
      - The author’s report reflects actual tool behavior and default configuration.
    falsifiers:
      - Replications show Gas Town does not support autonomous merges or does not merge when tests fail under similar conditions.

      Sehn reports that approximately 60 minutes of Gas Town usage cost about $100 in Claude tokens—roughly 10× the cost
      of a normal Claude Code session per unit time.

    source_ids: ["dolthub-2026-day-in-gas-town"]
    operationalization: >-
      Run matched sessions (task difficulty held constant) in Claude Code vs Gas Town; compare token spend and wall-clock
      time-to-acceptable-PR under similar supervision.
    assumptions:
      - Costs are comparable across models/pricing and configuration.
    falsifiers:
      - Controlled comparisons show similar or lower costs per unit time for Gas Town.

      High-parallelism coding-agent orchestration can exceed operator comprehension such that humans monitor a single
      summary channel (e.g., a coordinator agent) while many agents work in parallel, increasing stress and reducing
      situational awareness.

    source_ids: ["dolthub-2026-day-in-gas-town"]
    operationalization: >-
      Run user studies supervising N parallel agents; measure comprehension, error detection, stress, and intervention
      latency as a function of N and UI (dashboards, task graphs, summaries).
    assumptions:
      - Operator comprehension can be reliably measured across comparable tasks.
    falsifiers:
      - Operators maintain situational awareness and low stress at high parallelism with appropriate UI and gating.

      Using a Dolt database as the backend for an agent task ledger like Beads could replace the split Git+SQLite design
      and improve merge/conflict handling and provenance queries for agents.

    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["dolthub-2026-day-in-gas-town"]
    operationalization: >-
      Build a Beads-compatible backend on Dolt and compare conflict rate, sync overhead, and agent conflict-resolution
      success versus Git+JSONL+SQLite across multi-contributor and multi-agent workloads.
    assumptions:
      - Task-ledger updates map cleanly to Dolt’s merge model and diff tooling.
    falsifiers:
      - Dolt backends increase operational complexity without reducing conflicts or improving agent resolution.

      Safe use of high-autonomy, high-parallelism coding-agent orchestrators requires explicit guardrails and governance
      gates (e.g., prevent merges unless tests pass) because default autonomy can create runaway integration risk.

    operationalization: >-
      Compare incident, rollback, and defect rates for teams using orchestrators with and without strict merge/test gates;
      measure time-to-detection for bad merges and overall throughput.
    assumptions:
      - Guardrails can be enforced reliably in the repo/CI environment.
    falsifiers:
      - High-autonomy orchestrators remain safe without additional governance gates in production settings.
