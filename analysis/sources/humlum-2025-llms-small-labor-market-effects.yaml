      NBER working paper using survey-to-admin record linkage in Denmark. Strong on data access and identification for
      hours/earnings outcomes; weaker on capturing subjective fatigue, boundary blur, and informal/unrecorded work;
      pre-publication/peer-review status.

      In NBER Working Paper 33777, occupation-wide survey data imply modest average benefits from AI chatbots:
      about ~3% time savings for the typical user.

    operationalization: >-
      Recompute the paper’s time-savings estimates from survey responses (usage frequency × time saved per usage day)
      and express as a percent of total work hours.
    assumptions:
      - Survey responses on time saved are truthful and consistently interpreted.
    falsifiers:
      - Paper revisions or replication show materially different average time savings under the same coding.

    text: >-
      In NBER Working Paper 33777, difference-in-differences estimates linking chatbot adoption surveys to Danish
      administrative labor records find precise null effects on earnings and recorded hours at worker and workplace
      levels, ruling out effects larger than about 2% two years after.

    evidence_level: "E3"

    source_ids: ["humlum-2025-llms-small-labor-market-effects"]
    operationalization: >-
      Replicate the DiD specifications using the same admin outcomes (earnings, recorded hours) and adoption/initiative
      measures; verify confidence intervals and robustness checks.
    assumptions:
      - Administrative recorded hours and earnings capture meaningful net labor-market outcomes.
    falsifiers:
      - Replication finds significant adoption-linked changes in earnings/hours in the same data/time window.

    text: >-
      In NBER Working Paper 33777, chatbot adoption is associated with work reallocation: workers often reallocate
      saved time to other tasks rather than reducing total work, and employer chatbot initiatives predict the emergence
      of new AI-related job tasks.

    domain: "LABOR"
    evidence_level: "E3"
    credence: 0.70
    source_ids: ["humlum-2025-llms-small-labor-market-effects"]
    operationalization: >-
      Use survey modules on task reallocation and new tasks; test whether employer encouragement predicts new task
      incidence after controlling for occupation and firm characteristics.
    assumptions:
      - Survey task categories correspond to meaningful changes in work composition.
    falsifiers:
      - Evidence shows time savings primarily cash out as reduced hours, and employer initiatives do not predict new tasks.
