      Social-media theorizing with confident quantifiers (“10–15% of the population”) and analogies to gambling
      reinforcement. Useful as a hypothesis generator and framing, not as evidence for prevalence or effect sizes.

      - ai
      - burnout
      - dopamine
      - reinforcement
      - flow

      Rapid AI feedback can create a powerful reinforcement loop (analogized to variable-ratio reinforcement),
      making long work sessions feel effortless or “fun” while increasing total time spent.

    source_ids: ["aakashgupta-2026-ai-dopamine-loop-thread"]
    operationalization: >-
      Measure AI interaction latency/reward frequency and relate to persistence, break-taking, and self-reported
      compulsion/overwork across cohorts.
    assumptions:
      - “Reward” can be operationalized (useful output; perceived progress).
    falsifiers:
      - Controlled studies show AI feedback reduces persistence or has no effect on overwork measures.

    text: >-
      AI tools can reduce natural stopping points in knowledge work (less waiting/blocking), shifting the bottleneck
      from execution to idea generation and making work harder to step away from (“one prompt away”).

    operationalization: >-
      Compare before/after AI adoption on measured break frequency, after-hours micro-work, and task “open thread”
      counts; test whether “waiting time” decreases and stopping points erode.
    assumptions:
      - Stopping points can be proxied by breaks, task completion boundaries, and after-hours continuation.
    falsifiers:
      - Telemetry shows more and clearer stopping points (more recovery) after AI adoption.

      Only a small minority of people (on the order of 10–15%) will thrive under high-frequency AI feedback loops,
      while most will find them overwhelming, shaping value capture and displacement.

    operationalization: >-
      Measure adoption and performance outcomes by stable traits (novelty seeking, conscientiousness, multitasking
      tolerance) across large cohorts; test for bimodality and estimate fractions who benefit vs are overwhelmed.
    assumptions:
      - Trait measures are stable and predictive of tool experience.
    falsifiers:
      - Large cohort data shows benefits are broadly distributed without a strong 10–15% concentration.
