      Self-analysis of a public repository’s git history and scc output to bound an upper tail of software
      development throughput. Strong for the raw measurements (git history, churn, scc snapshot); weak for causal
      attribution (how much was due to AI vs reuse/scope choices) and for generalization to typical projects and
      workflows.

      The Reality Check framework repository (`lhl/realitycheck`) history through tag `v0.3.0` spans from its
      first commit dated 2026-01-20 to the `v0.3.0` tag dated 2026-02-01, and contains 160 commits.

      Recompute using `git show -s --format=%ci v0.3.0`, `git show -s --format=%ci $(git rev-list --max-parents=0 v0.3.0)`,
      and `git rev-list --count v0.3.0`.
    assumptions: []
    falsifiers:
      - Recomputing from the repository history yields materially different dates or commit count.

      At tag `v0.3.0`, `scc` reports the Reality Check framework codebase contains about 45,920 total lines across
      179 files, and estimates (COCOMO) a schedule effort of about 14.54 months (organic mode).

    operationalization: >-
      Check out the `v0.3.0` tag in a detached worktree and run `scc .`; compare totals (lines/files) and the
      reported COCOMO schedule effort.
    assumptions:
      - The `scc` version and configuration are comparable across runs.
    falsifiers:
      - Running `scc` at the `v0.3.0` tag yields materially different totals or COCOMO schedule estimates.

      Comparing (a) the ~12-day calendar window from first commit to `v0.3.0` tag with (b) `scc`’s ~14.5-month
      COCOMO schedule estimate suggests that, in at least some greenfield software projects, delivery pace can be
      compressed by an order of magnitude relative to conventional baselines; this comparison is non-causal and
      COCOMO may overestimate for small, well-scoped projects.

    operationalization: >-
      Compute (tag_date - first_commit_date) and compare to the COCOMO schedule-effort estimate. Evaluate
      sensitivity by repeating on other repos/projects and by using alternative baseline estimation methods.
    assumptions:
      - The COCOMO schedule estimate is a useful (even if noisy) baseline for rough comparison.
    falsifiers:
      - Repeated case studies find COCOMO is systematically miscalibrated such that the comparison does not
        indicate unusual delivery speed.
