      Western analysts and interpretation of PRC signaling language. Treat motive stories as hypotheses.

      In PRC elite-politics practice, senior officials placed under investigation for “serious discipline and law
      violations” are typically detained and investigations are routinely followed by formal dismissal.

      Build a dataset of publicly announced “investigation opened” cases for senior PLA/party officials and
      measure the fraction that end in dismissal vs exoneration/return-to-office.
    assumptions:
      - Publicly visible cases are representative of the broader pattern.
    falsifiers:
      - Many public “investigation opened” cases end without dismissal or with restoration to office.

      The investigation of Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli, combined with earlier removals, has effectively hollowed
      out the Central Military Commission, leaving Xi Jinping and Zhang Shengmin described as the only active
      named members.

      Compare a dated, authoritative CMC roster definition against outlet descriptions (total vs uniformed members;
      “active” vs “formally still in post under investigation”).
    assumptions:
      - Reporting reflects the de facto leadership vacuum.
    falsifiers:
      - Authoritative roster shows multiple other active members in post.

      A new wave of PLA purges began around 2023 with the Rocket Force and later spread to other services as well
      as the PLA’s procurement and political departments.

    operationalization: >-
      Construct a dated timeline of senior removals by service/department and test whether the Rocket Force was
      the initial locus and whether later targets match the described spread pattern.
    assumptions:
      - Publicly known removals reflect the main campaign’s progression.
    falsifiers:
      - Timeline shows a materially different ordering or campaign scope.

      Xi Jinping’s decision to move against Zhang Youxia may reflect frustration with Zhang’s failure to deliver
      sufficient modernization and readiness progress ahead of the PLA’s reported Taiwan capability deadline.

      Look for internal PRC signals emphasizing performance/modernization failures (training critiques, procurement
      shortfalls, readiness benchmarks) and for purge targets clustered in performance-critical roles.
    assumptions:
      - Xi uses purges partly as performance enforcement, not only political discipline.
    falsifiers:
      - Replacement pattern and propaganda emphasize only political loyalty and clique-breaking, not readiness.

      Zhang Youxia (or close associates/family) may be implicated in procurement corruption, potentially linked to
      his earlier oversight of weapons development and procurement institutions.

    operationalization: >-
      Track whether the investigation narrative focuses on procurement/promotion bribery and whether associated
      procurement officials/entities are targeted in parallel.
    assumptions:
      - Corruption allegations, when present, map to underlying wrongdoing rather than pure pretext.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible internal accounts indicate no procurement nexus and that charges are primarily political.

    text: >-
      Factional rivalry within the PLA and elite “princeling” networks is a plausible driver of Zhang Youxia’s purge,
      with Zhang’s accumulated authority becoming a perceived threat to Xi Jinping.

      Map purge targets to patronage networks and early-career unit overlaps; test whether removals disproportionately
      hit one network and whether propaganda emphasizes clique-breaking and “CMC chairman responsibility system.”
    assumptions:
      - Elite networks can be inferred from public career histories and known patronage ties.
    falsifiers:
      - Targets show no network clustering and align better with procurement/performance issues across factions.

      The U.S. Department of Defense’s annual report on China’s military assessed that senior-officer removals caused
      uncertainty in PLA organizational priorities and that procurement corruption produced observed capability shortfalls
      (including cited issues such as malfunctioning missile-silo lids).

      Locate and quote the relevant DoD report passages (page/section) and compare with any later corrections or
      corroborating intelligence reporting.
    assumptions:
      - The published DoD report accurately reflects the assessment described.
    falsifiers:
      - The report lacks these claims or is materially revised to remove them.

      The ongoing investigations and leadership upheaval very likely risk short-term disruptions in the PLA’s operational
      effectiveness, though the PLA could emerge more proficient later if systemic corruption is reduced.

      Track indicators of training tempo, exercise complexity, command appointments, and mishap rates in the months after
      the purge; compare against pre-purge baselines.
    assumptions:
      - Leadership disruption meaningfully affects near-term training and command-and-control.
    falsifiers:
      - Training tempo/complexity and operational indicators show no degradation after the purge.

      A 2027 target for the PLA to be capable of taking Taiwan is widely reported in Western reporting and is commonly
      attributed to U.S. intelligence assessments of Xi Jinping’s guidance.

      Distinguish “U.S.-assessed target” vs “confirmed PRC order” by locating primary U.S. official statements and any
      PRC documents; track whether subsequent U.S. intel updates revise the target.
    assumptions:
      - Public U.S. statements are based on credible intelligence rather than pure signaling.
    falsifiers:
      - Credible disclosures show the 2027 target claim was based on misinterpretation or is formally retracted.
