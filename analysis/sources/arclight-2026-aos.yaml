      Internal operating philosophy describing an institution design pattern (“AOS”) intended to produce
      durable “human coherence” (“arclight”). The document is rhetorically forceful and constraint-oriented,
      but offers little empirical grounding; many central constructs are non-operational (“phase change,”
      “quantum selectivity”) and the “must remain hidden” doctrine raises ethical concerns around informed
      consent and cult-dynamics risk.

      AOS is a systems-level operating philosophy for designing capital, programs, governance, and
      environments to upgrade human capacity without ideology, coercion, or founder dependence.

    domain: "INST"

    source_ids: ["arclight-2026-aos"]
    operationalization: >-
      Define measurable capacity metrics (ambiguity tolerance, responsibility-taking, ego-defense
      reduction) and compare outcomes across AOS-compliant vs non-compliant institutions.
    assumptions:
      - Institution design can drive durable changes in participant capacity.
      - Claims can be operationalized without adopting ideological definitions.
    falsifiers:
      - Measured outcomes show no improvement over controls or require explicit ideology/authority to sustain.

    text: >-
      "Arclight" is an irreversible phase change in a person’s capacity to hold ambiguity, responsibility,
      and meaning without reverting to fear-based identity or ego defense.

    domain: "SOC"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.25
    source_ids: ["arclight-2026-aos"]
    operationalization: >-
      Longitudinally track participants for relapse and stability of measured capacity metrics after leaving
      the environment; compare to controls and to known behavior-change interventions.
    assumptions:
      - The claimed phase change corresponds to measurable psychological constructs.
      - Relapse/stability can be measured over multi-year horizons.
    falsifiers:
      - Participants exhibit relapse rates comparable to controls.
      - No stable post-exit changes are detectable on operationalized measures.

      Modern society has a structural gap where technical capability scales faster than meaning/coherence,
      contributing to identity collapse and extremism/numbness.

    domain: "SOC"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.50
    source_ids: ["arclight-2026-aos"]
    operationalization: >-
      Correlate capability growth proxies (automation/AI penetration, productivity) with longitudinal
      measures of meaning/wellbeing and with extremism/numbness indicators, controlling for confounders.
    assumptions:
      - Meaning/coherence can be proxied with validated surveys and social indicators.
      - Capability growth is separable from other societal changes.
    falsifiers:
      - Meaning/coherence measures improve in step with capability growth.
      - Extremism/numbness trends are not associated with capability scaling proxies.

      AOS has kernel invariants including agency is mandatory, depth precedes scale, founder authority must
      decay structurally, and ego/urgency/ideology are treated as security risks.

      - The document does not include these invariants or materially differs.

      Capital should flow one-way into time: surplus enters an endowment and principal never exits.
    type: "[A]"
    domain: "ECON"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["arclight-2026-aos"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare mission durability and governance outcomes across institutions with strict endowment lock-in
      vs spenddown vs venture-like capital structures.
    assumptions:
      - Endowment lock-in is feasible and enforceable.
      - Lock-in changes organizational tempo and reduces short-term optimization pressures.
    falsifiers:
      - Comparable or better durability occurs without strict principal lock-in.
      - Endowment lock-in leads to stagnation or new failure modes (rent-seeking, misgovernance).

      AOS should remain hidden initially; early disclosure causes it to become ideology/identity/performance
      and harms outcomes.

    domain: "INST"
    evidence_level: "E6"
    credence: 0.35
    source_ids: ["arclight-2026-aos"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare transparent vs staged-disclosure versions of similar programs and measure
      dependency/performance effects, trust, and participant outcomes.
    assumptions:
      - Disclosure level causally affects participant behavior.
      - Performance/identity capture can be measured.
    falsifiers:
      - Transparent disclosure yields equal-or-better outcomes with lower harm risk.
      - No measurable performance-capture effects from disclosure.

      Programs should be legitimate without AOS language, involve real stakes, avoid spiritual framing,
      require effort/cost, produce real outputs, and preserve dignity.

      Define a rubric for these program properties and test whether programs scoring highly are associated
      with improved participant outcomes and reduced cult/ideology dynamics.
    assumptions:
      - These design constraints are measurable and enforceable.
      - Outputs and stakes produce maturation rather than harm.
    falsifiers:
      - Programs meeting the rubric do not outperform alternatives on outcomes or safety indicators.

      The same AOS-compliant environment can trigger arclight for some participants but not others
      ("quantum selectivity"), and trying to make everyone awaken collapses systems into coercion/ideology/performance.

      Model heterogeneous treatment effects in longitudinal program outcomes; test whether broad reliability
      can be increased without coercive dynamics via personalization, consent, and governance.
    assumptions:
      - Outcome heterogeneity is intrinsic rather than purely environmental.
      - Coercion/ideology dynamics can be measured and separated from outcomes.
    falsifiers:
      - Outcomes can be made broadly reliable without coercion/ideology dynamics via transparent design changes.
