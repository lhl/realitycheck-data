    operationalization: >-
      Recompute the “>50% crossing day” metric from Taiwan MND’s published time series/daily releases and compare
      annual day counts for 2023 vs 2024 under the same rules.
    assumptions:
      - The “detected aircraft” denominator is defined consistently across years.
    falsifiers:
      - A primary-data recomputation yields materially different annual day counts.
