      Newsletter-style practitioner note based on limited but direct observation (“two or three teams”). Strong on
      pattern recognition and workflow hypotheses; weak on quantification and selection bias (seeing unusually
      successful early adopters).

      “Compounding teams” achieve superlinear productivity by building frameworks around models (tool calling, hooks,
      flow control, strategies) rather than using out-of-the-box coding assistants alone.

    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["schillace-2025-compounding-teams"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare teams using commodity tools vs bespoke frameworks, controlling for team skill and task mix; measure
      long-run throughput, defect rates, and maintenance burden over 6–12 months.
    assumptions:
      - “Compounding” can be operationalized as increasing output per unit input over time.
    falsifiers:
      - After controls, bespoke frameworks do not outperform commodity tools on long-run outcomes.

  - id: "TECH-2025-066"
    text: >-
      High-performing “compounding teams” rely heavily on filesystem and git (plus common programmer tools) as durable
      infrastructure for model-based action and self-modification.

    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.60
    source_ids: ["schillace-2025-compounding-teams"]
    operationalization: >-
      Survey compounding-style teams and categorize memory substrates (filesystem/git, DBs, vector stores, CRDTs);
      correlate substrate choice with reliability and coordination outcomes.
    assumptions:
      - Substrate use can be measured and compared meaningfully across organizations.
    falsifiers:
      - Most successful teams do not rely on filesystem/git artifacts as the primary substrate.

    text: >-
      Compounding productivity can come from a recursive mindset: automate everything possible and instruct the coding
      system to build tools it needs, checking them into git as durable improvements (“build a tool for making a tool”).

    source_ids: ["schillace-2025-compounding-teams"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track tool creation and reuse over time in compounding teams; measure whether new tools reduce marginal cost
      and increase output, net of maintenance effort.
    assumptions:
      - Tool reuse is frequent enough to amortize creation cost.
    falsifiers:
      - Tool-building recursion increases complexity and does not produce sustained throughput gains.

      In “compounding teams,” the bottleneck shifts from implementation to human attention: throughput increases such
      that ideas and parallel processes outstrip steering and review capacity.

    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.55
    source_ids: ["schillace-2025-compounding-teams"]
    operationalization: >-
      Measure time allocation and queueing delays (ideation/steering vs implementation vs verification) in teams
      using high-autonomy agents; test whether attention becomes dominant constraint.
    assumptions:
      - Implementation time decreases substantially relative to steering capacity.
    falsifiers:
      - Verification/compliance or integration remains the dominant bottleneck rather than attention.

      Schillace reports that compounding teams have API/token spend routinely in the hundreds of dollars per day (with
      one team aiming for ~$1,000/day), and that some shipping-product teams have not directly touched or looked at code
      in multiple months.

    domain: "ECON"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.50
    source_ids: ["schillace-2025-compounding-teams"]
    operationalization: >-
      Collect accounting logs from such teams and measure spend per engineer per day; instrument code interaction
      events (edits/reviews) over time to validate “not touching code” claims.
    assumptions:
      - Teams can provide trustworthy accounting and telemetry.
    falsifiers:
      - Measured spend is far lower/higher and/or teams routinely touch code despite the claim.

    text: >-
      Continuous executable validation (acceptance tests) and decomposition into solvable pieces are central to
      compounding-team workflows because models are not trusted and correctness must be enforced by execution.

    domain: "TECH"
    evidence_level: "E5"
    credence: 0.65
    source_ids: ["schillace-2025-compounding-teams"]
    operationalization: >-
      Compare incident/defect rates for teams with strong executable acceptance gates vs weaker gates under similar
      autonomy; measure whether stronger gates enable longer autonomous runs safely.
    assumptions:
      - Acceptance tests can be designed to reflect real-world correctness.
    falsifiers:
      - Teams succeed with long autonomy without continuous acceptance testing or decomposition discipline.
