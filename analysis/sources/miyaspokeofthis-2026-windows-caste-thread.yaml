      Heavy stereotyping and scapegoating (“Windows is awful because… Indians”); rhetorical sarcasm; no primary
      citations; points to embedded X links (inaccessible here) and screenshots rather than verifiable documents.
      Treat Microsoft-specific complaint details and “Python vs C++” claims as unverified without primary records.

      Microsoft’s Windows operating system is “awful” because Microsoft employs “so many Indians”
      (i.e., workforce nationality/ethnicity causally explains product quality).

    operationalization: >-
      Define measurable “Windows quality” outcomes and test whether workforce ethnicity/nationality composition
      predicts them after controlling for architecture, process, incentives, and organizational complexity.
    assumptions:
      - Workforce ethnicity/nationality is a meaningful causal driver of software quality.
    falsifiers:
      - Empirical evidence shows no relationship after controlling for confounders; or shows opposite direction.

      Caste discrimination in tech/IT workplaces has been credibly alleged and has been the subject of major
      legal actions in the United States (e.g., California DFEH/CRD’s lawsuit against Cisco alleging caste-based
      discrimination).

      formally brought in a major tech workplace case.
    assumptions:
      - Official public records accurately describe the existence of the case and its caste-discrimination theory.
    falsifiers:
      - Authoritative legal records show no such case was filed or that caste was not at issue.

      A credible, active complaint/case exists alleging caste-based discrimination at Microsoft’s Hyderabad office

    falsifiers:
      - Jurisdictional records show no such filing; or reputable outlets debunk the story.

      At Microsoft (as described in the thread), caste status determines assignment to “Python” projects versus
      being relegated to “C++/Java” work or even janitorial duties.

      Confirm via a verified complaint/court record, HR investigation, or independent reporting with named sources
      that such caste-linked language assignment occurred.
    assumptions:

    falsifiers:
      - Verified records show no such claims were made in any complaint; or show the assignment claims were false.

      Compile a bibliography of credible journalism, policy reports, and documented cases featuring first-person
      accounts; assess volume, independence, and representativeness.
    assumptions:

    falsifiers:
      - A systematic review finds reports are rare, non-independent, or largely debunked.
