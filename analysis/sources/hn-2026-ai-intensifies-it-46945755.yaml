      A common interpretation among participants in the HN discussion of “AI Doesn’t Reduce Work—It Intensifies It”
      is a Jevons-style rebound: AI efficiency gains raise expectations and expand workload rather than reducing work.

    operationalization: >-
      Survey a representative sample of AI adopters about expectation changes (targets, responsiveness norms, scope)
      and test whether perceived/actual workload changes correlate with AI adoption intensity.
    assumptions:
      - HN-commenter narratives reflect a broader dynamic rather than niche culture.
    falsifiers:
      - Representative data shows most orgs convert gains into reduced workload and recovery, not expanded expectations.

      HN commenters report that AI enables task expansion across roles (e.g., QA/support producing AI-assisted fixes),
      which can shift burden downstream to engineers for review, cleanup, and integration, increasing coordination load.

    operationalization: >-
      Measure cross-role code contributions and review time before/after AI adoption; quantify whether net review
      burden rises or falls (and for whom).
    assumptions:
      - Review/cleanup time is a key bottleneck and measurable from repo tooling and time tracking.
    falsifiers:
      - Data shows cross-role AI-assisted contributions reduce net review/maintenance burden.

      A minority view expressed in the HN thread is that AI-driven work intensification is transitional: as AI replaces
      human labor, remaining humans are temporarily overloaded while trying to stay employed, but the steady state is
      reduced human labor rather than intensified human work.

    source_ids: ["hn-2026-ai-intensifies-it-46945755"]
    operationalization: >-
      Track role changes, layoffs, and workload measures across firms over multiple years; test whether initial
      overload phases predict later substitution and reduced human labor demand.
    assumptions:
      - Overload is a transitional marker of substitution rather than a stable regime.
    falsifiers:
      - Long-run data shows stable adoption with no displacement and no systematic overload phase.
