> OpenAI states Codex agents operate in isolated sandboxes: cloud agents run in isolated containers with network access disabled by default; local Codex runs commands in OS-level sandboxes (macOS Seatbelt, Linux seccomp+landlock, Windows sandbox/WSL), restricting edits to the workspace by default, with optional user approval for unsandboxed execution.
