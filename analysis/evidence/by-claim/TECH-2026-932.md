> OpenAI reports GPT-5.3-Codex was trained to avoid data-destructive actions (e.g., rm -rf, git clean -xfd, git reset --hard, push --force) by using RL rollouts with a “user model” that makes conflicting edits and rewarding the model for not reverting user-produced changes; OpenAI also reports improved performance on a destructive-actions avoidance evaluation (0.88 for GPT-5.3-Codex vs 0.76 for GPT-5.2-Codex).
